                In order to get my secure key activated, I had to use telephone banking; there's no way to do it online. However, I am partially deaf and struggled to hear and understand the person who helped me to reset my password and get the securekey thing activated and set up a voice recognition password. In addition, in order to reset my telephone password, the system asked me for my password, despite my explaining already that I had forgotten it.I don't fault the people who staff the phones and the chat, but HSBC's system is crap. It has no facilities for the partially deaf except the CS rep trying to speak slowly and loudly. Her strong accent made it even harder to understand her.HSBC needs to consider that not everyone can hear clearly on a phone, and they NEED an online system to do some things like activate the secure keys.            
                Declined mortgage after 4 weeks processing. Given no explanation why it was declined. Terrible experience. Avoid at any cost! Totally waste of time and traumatic experience.            
                I made the mistake of signing up with this utterly useless bank when I moved to the UK. Setting up an account "online" ended up costing me about 8 visits to the branch after repeated stuff-ups at their end. I had two pay cheques bounce after the account was set up incorrectly. Now, several months later I cringe every time I have to deal with them because I know it will involve at least an hour on the phone, plus they'll probably be experiencing "technical difficulties" of some kind and won't be able to help. This is the only institution I've ever bothered writing a letter of complaint to. The one nice thing about them is that their customer service people are always so friendly - I feel sorry for them and have no idea how they manage to stay so polite, given they must constantly deal with extremely irritated people.            
                Into my 3rd week of trying to speak to someone regarding a SBL....No one and i mean no one has the capabillity of taking the call - The staff sound bored and lifeless - Pointing out theat it is now the 7th person you have spoken to makes no differance - After 6 calls and emails to my ' relationship manager ' i was told that i dont have one !! An appointment was made for a call and the ' handler ' called 15 mins early which has now oput me back on a forever waiting list.YOU missed the appointment not me!!..Shocking service shocking staff with couldnt care less attitude - Put in a complaint and i know that that will also fall on deaf ears !......Chose them years ago as we had a local branch - It shut down same year !! Now have to travel for absolutley everything - Clean up your act or you will loose even more customers....            
                Have been asked to verify my address in Japan and the options who can verify my documents were as followed:Embassy/Consulate - They can only verify documents made in the UK. They can not verify my Japanese driving licence or residency card.Local Bank - I made enquiries at both Resona and SMBC and both had never heard of such a request before and naturally after asking around both said no.Lawyer - I got a list of lawyers from the Embassy and worked my way through the ones most local to me. The list is a bit out of date but eventually found an English speaking lawyer who can do the request. Have been told it will cost me between 5,000 and 10,000 yen and the cost of travel to their office will be 1,000 yen. HSBC says it will pay back these expenses and I wonder how much money do they waste on upsetting long term customers and getting them to go to lawyers. I hope it is less than what will be saved in fraud prevention.I would advise anyone thinking of moving to Japan to move their money elsewhere before getting on a plane. Once in Japan it is more or less impossible to bank comfortably with HSBCUPDATE the cost for a lawyer to translate my driving licence and verify two documents was 16,200 yen. At 146 yen to pound that is 110 pounds.            
                I have been messed about for over a week by HSBC regarding a mortgage enquiry. The staff do not seem to know their rules. Really poor service and communication. I have now made the decision that no matter what response they give. I will not apply for a mortgage with them. As a retired broker, I know what is required and HSBC fall well short. Appalling            
                Appalling waste of time filling on complicated forms and following convoluted processes to then waste more time and money on calls to a call centre to be left on hold and then told 'have to go to a branch'. Sent numerous security codes, names,pass numbers etc. etc. which then don't work during log-in process and blocks any attempt to proceed.Told them 'not to bother' completing my application I would go elsewhere as already wasted hours on application process and they just weren't bothered. Appalling frustrating experience and how dare they waste other people's valuable time. One plus point is that I'm steering clear now ! Hate to think of service further down the line.            
                Been trying to setup a business account with them for over a month now. I've been lied to multiple times about how much longer it will take. When I phone them I always get some complete moron who literally has no clue. Moving my business elsewhere, I'd advise anyone looking to setup an account to do the same            
                Absolutely terrible.  After my physical secure key stopped working I decided to download the mobile app.  It took ages to set up and I found it difficult to remember what I used as a password and a secure key, as both need you to use a combination of both numbers and letters.  I now can't get on to my mobile/online banking as my device (phone and laptop) is no longer compatible with the app.  I have no intention of changing my phone, so after 22 years of banking with HSBC I will be moving to a different bank with more user friendly internet banking.            
                The new website is the most horrific user experience of any online bank. To the point where I'm going to have to move banks. All the core functionality is squirrelled away            
                Not really impressed with HSBC Business banking they don't know what they are doing and have no real personal business managers to deal with your issues who have any authority! Even the branch don't know who their business manager is!!! Fills you with hope!            
                Consistently feel disappointed at being a customer of HSBC bank. The customer service team are both incompetent and rude. I really do expect so much better from 'the world's local bank'. It's just a matter of time before I change banks to be brutally honest.            
                0 star, below 0, non-sense, unacceptable.            
                YET AGAIN HSBC HAVE MESSED UP AGAIN, AS FOR COPY OF BANK STATEMENTS AND TWICE THEY SENT THE INCORRECT COPYSMY ADVISE LOG ALL YOUR COMPLAINTS WITH THE Financial ombudsman HOPEFULLY THIS WILL GET THEM TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER            
                Terrible service. Switching banks            
                Took a Â£1500 payment twice from my account (system mallfunction). I'm on my overdraft, trying to get my money back for 5 (working) days now. I feel robbed! Deffinetly lost me as a client.            
                Have banked with HSBC prev Midland for years. No real issues. Until now, Issues with money leaving account. Branch cannot deal with, telephone banking dealt with as far as possible and was advised would have a call back from I believe a fraud section. have spoken twice - really cannot understand the people I am speaking to. When you have an issue of this kind you really do need to be able to speak to someone in the UK that you can understand. Didn't help that they told me I would have the call on my mobile number which I gave them, came home to find a message on my answerphone whilst I was in work but they also phoned me in work meaning I had to discuss the whole issue at my desk in an open plan office!!! I asked for a call to my mobile. that was the only number they DID NOT phone!!!! Fully appreciate that this bank is  now Hong Kong owned. Unfortunately if I cannot deal with such issues locally I now need to switch accounts. Just feel let down I have banked with them for 30+ years and my father before me. This together with 6 weeks of issues on phone daily over a society account that I am treasure of and my patience has run out. I am switching.            
                90 minutes on the phone on the PC and on a mobile app to deregister and reregister with online banking and transfer a euros payment to France. Shockingly bad system and what was 86p to the euro at the beginning had become 90p by the time I made the transaction.Appalling, hideous, atiquated awful, timewasting system. AAAAgh. Hate them            
                Not everyone who puts 5 stars is an HSBC employee, made to write a review with the threat of being sacked... I guess.            
                I have been a customer for around 15years. From setting up in a branch through to the move to online banking they have never put a foot wrong. Online banking is incredibly simple. Getting through on the phone is easy and doesn't take too long to get to a person. Very happy and wouldn't switch to anyone else.            
                Disgusted this morning when I made an appointment to see someone after getting no guidance from a phone call.  I made an appoint in the Portishead branch of HSBC.  It took all of 5 minutes.  The answer was NO to providing a reference to a landlord - HSBC don't do references.  We have been loyal customers for over 40 years.  Asked did this not matter?  He shrugged his shoulders and said NO.  I said if I take my business elsewhere will not matter.  Again a shrug of his shoulders.  NO.  So that is what I am doing today.  Changing banks.            
                They advertise 3.3 Apr on personal loans and gave me 12 Apr After recently paid a credit in full with the same bank            
                Absolute joke of a bank. I have been a customer for 19 years and do not have 1 positive thing to say about them. They are completely incompetent. A few years ago, I was stationed overseas with the RAF. HSBC knew my address was an overseas address yet regularly cancelled my card because it was being used in another country and I hadn't told them I was travelling. The solution offered was to go into my local branch (1200 miles away) to draw money over the counter. Since then things have gone downhill. A recent complaint was getting nothing except the usual scripted answers so I escalated it higher myself. I emailed the CEO and was treated with such contempt it's unbelievable. He has no regard for the customers, just as long as he gets his bonus for making our lives hell.            
                Having been an unfortunate customer since the last century, I simply cannot put into words how unpleasant, uncouth, dishonest, unsupportive, and thoroughly vile HSBC, and sadly, it's employees are. There exists an all encompassing contemptible culture and working practice that would leave anyone dumb founded. They would put broken glass and nails in your shoes if they were able. For over a decade HSBC have provided me with literally ZERO support in both personal and business banking, on the contrary, they have systematically determined themselves as the enemy.  Just seeing their logo any where, or their misleading "we're so nice" TV ads, really stresses me out. DO what I did, and find ANY other bank....            
                THIS IS THE WORST BANK EVERTHE TELEPHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF ARE TOTALLY INCOMPETENT AND UNHELPFULTO GET ANYTHING RESOLVED OVER THE PHONE TAKES AROUND 25MINS            
                Disgrace Policy  of  HSBC I have claim my legally PPI from HSBC through Action Direcet ( they have done a marvellous job ), HSBC has/is trying all it can and has it's power to delay the payment or make me to drop the claim.  Story begins with:) 1) we do not have such a client  with this name and details, after they were presented with my bank statements and bank details they retreated the claim.2) HSBC says in a new claim we can not recognise the signiture , then the HSBC was given a signiture which matched the one they had in their system.3)  Now HSBC  claims they do not recognise my address, went to the branch again with ID, provided my working address and home address.  4)  Again HSBC claims those addresses and the signifiers are not matching this time , had an other to HSBC branch provided again the same papers.5) Yesterday I received an other letter from HSBC asking for the same thing!!!' spent 2 hrs on the phone , and now at the HSBS branch 3 people looking into the matter they can not hold anyone from PPI. call centre in India is going to call me back.  I say enough is enough HSBC pay my claim back.            
                Tried to remortgage with them, after missing two telephone appointments they eventually went through all the criteria, came back a couple of days later with a decline due to affordability which is absolute rubbish, even the mortgage adviser was puzzled. Don't waste your time trying to talk to these people, better of with Natwest or Woolwich!            
                This bank deserves nothing but failure. Dishonest at every level. Incompetent at every level. Arrogant at every level. Uncaring at every level.Spare your blood pressure and walk on by. Don't EVER EVER get involved with HSBC. There is not one single redeeming feature or any good word you can say. Relationship director - arrogant beyond belief ,  Customer support - impossible to get. Complaints - impossible to be heard. Don't even get me started on the Indian call centres. There is no bank thats a good bank these days (Triodos Bank maybe the exception) but these people at HSBC - they truly take the prize. Read the Rolling Stone article "Gangster Bankers - Too Big to Jail" from 2013 or indeed the many many articles that report just how bad HSBC is.            
                NEVER EVER EVER EVER USE THIS BANK 0.5 STARS I'D GIVE ZERO - USELESS INCOMPETENT GUTLESS IDIOTS. DO NOT BANK WITH THEM EVER - NEVER EVER EVER EVER!            
                If you expect any kind of customer service at all, stay well away from HSBC. I have had a problem with my card for 8 years now and no one bothers to fix it. The problem lies with HSBC. Our postcode is registered incorrectly in their databank . I regularly get error messages telling me that, but HSBC can't fix it. Hell knows why. So about 40% of the time my online transactions fail. Currently my card is not working at all. I have tried calling HSBC 3 times. Each time I am put in a queue for 25 minutes (!), then I give up. It is impossible to talk to anyone. I have also contacted them via the online secure messaging service, but I don't get any response. They just don't care. I am premier customer by the way. I don't even want to know what regular customers experience. It is shocking.            
                After they took from me 900aed, They were trying to convince me that its because of few transactions which are on hold! After I called the Customer service for second time ( because the first operator was very not sure what is he talking about) I had to Go to The bank(Counter) (Mall of The Emirates) where the employee was selling me the same story (transactions on hold) and was very rude, and he told me that he can't print the statement for me because he doesn't have Internet!!!!!!?? After he printed the statement I saw that those transactions which were on hold are not on hold( they were deducted normally)  I realized that they took money from my account without a reason!So, my THIRD luck to explain the situation to operator was again unsuccessful and she arranged some department to call me back to explain the whole situation (after she said that she doesn't know how to explain those transaction on hold)After all my effort, after they didn't know how to explain the whole situation, MONEY JUST APEARED BACK TO MY ACCOUNT! insecurity about how many times they can deduct someone's money without people knowing that is freighting.definitely changing the bank ASAP!            
                If I could give 0 stars I would !!! Appalling the way they have treated my 92 year old mother. Refusing to tell her over the phone her interest earned because she can't give them her telephone banking security pin. She's never had one !!! They then asked her her name and dob and proceeded to tell her she'd failed security questions !!!!!!! Even refusing to post her the information. She has to go to her branch in 7 days time - she's housebound !!! They wouldn't listen !!!   You've been warned AVOID AT ALL COSTS            
                HSBC customer service.I'm getting a shiny new credit card from HSBC to replace my present card and it is from a different supplier with different number etc. I wanted to know a simple question that when it arrives do I have to pay it off with a new 'payee' account online or do I do nothing and the same 'payee' set up for the old card will suffice despite it being a different card?On-line chat eventually gave the advice of 'letting Amazon and others know I've changed my card' Well yes that's great (and obvious) but really not answering anything for me.Phoned HSBC and they said they had no record of a new card being sent out to me! Sitting half the afternoon in the local branch filling in details of the new card and all its glorious benefits must have been a dream the other day then?Not a great start to the supposed 'Premier' service from HSBC            
                Its just useless,the app the whole banking process,overcomplicated and very slow.The websie is a joke also....            
                Now it is the second time that a cheque is lost. Write an other is the advice to remedy the matter by HSBC. Is this service?            
                I administer a Charity account. We have ONLY been with HSBC 20 years. The account has now been locked for 5 weeks since May 3rd. I call and email everyday whilst the "Review" takes place. In desperation I have contacted the Financial Ombudsman. I get phone calls from 20 charities  asking  - where is the pledge we promised? The end is not yet in sightI am sure they could habe bought J P Morgan Bank with less deliberation!!            
                A very inefficient, cumbersome bank. After 6 weeks of phone calls, requests for this,requests for that, I gave up. The hours bank staff wasted and the paperwork posted to me was ludicrous. In the end I went to The Coventry Building Society and agreed a deal in 3 days. Their inefficiency continues and as a shareholder, I worry about the bank's ability to survive.            
                HSBC .. There new website is terrible. Everyone I know hates it and most are seriously considering leaving including me if something isn't done about it. Find a bank where you can actually see your money. Which is probably any other bank.            
                I have been banking with HSBC for 10 years for 4 companies with a total turnover of 5M.12 months ago we started a trade finance application. at the time they said that this should take around 2 months. 12 months has now passed and we are nowhere near the finish. Mainly because their incompetence. Since then they have changed our business manager 3 times and twice the trade finance advisor. each time it has taken months for the new person to start dealing with the application. they are though very quick to deal with anything that has charges that will be debited to your accounts.After receiving once again the wrong paper work to sign today, i just stopped the whole application  and will be moving all my businesses to santander.It is incredible how incompetent and unorganised they are considering  how big they are.I  urge anyone considering banking with them not to. you will live to regret it.            
                If you are thinking about it- don't. You will have to chase this bank for everything. It took 2 goes to get an account set up because they couldn't get the computer to accept account details. They promised Â£200 cash for switching and 3 months+ later and after chasing umpteen times I still don't have it. You will wait endlessly on the phone to get through to an agent. No one in this bank wants to own a customer problem. Being polite when you finally get through is not enough, they never resolve the query. I am switching back to my old bank tomorrow. I wish I had never changed in the first place.            
                Very pleased with the service...helpped me to build the credit score and had loans and everything.very helpful people.internet banking is fab            
                I applied for their Advance Current Account with a cash incentive for switching and staying. I satisfied the application criteria and my credit file was in perfect order with an above average score, yet they declined my application and quickly offered me a similar current account without the cash incentive. It seems very suspicious to me! I highly suspect they attract people with cash incentive payments, only to offer a product where no cash incentive is payable! I promptly initiated a complaint and appealled the decision, which they took months to deal with, with excuses of 'no trace' of my initial complaint and then that my application was no longer on the system due to the amount of time that had passed. Useless! Now I have a wasted 'hard search' on my credit file ð ð¬ð¡            
                Ridiculous waiting times in the Chiswick branch. To say there was only one customer in front of myself, and I pay this bank ridiculous fees every month, I should not have been waiting for as long as I was just to change my address.            
                I had fraud committed on my card, called HSBC Advance to advise and they told me I need to wait until the transactions had gone through before i can claim. I have to do all the running around and call them in 3 days which leaves me with no access to my funds. Not good enough considering I have been a customer for over 10 years.Seriously thinking about closing my account and changing banks now.            
                Applied for a loan at the Advertised "lowest ever rate" 3.3% to be told I had a bad credit rating with a credit reference company , And then hiked the percentage rate to 16.9%!!. as it turned out this was a blatant lie credit rating was nothing of the sort!! They use the term "representative" to cover their tracks  and charge what they like ( and apparently they are within their rights to do so!) Daylight robbery if you ask me . BEWARE!!!!!            
                Kept me waiting on the phone for one hour 15 minutes twice this week. I reported in December last year that my account had been compromised and they said that they were sorting it out because someone cloned my card.Then I get a letter, three weeks ago, saying they're going to reclaiming/debit the fraud money from my account.I called them to say what's going on and they assured me that they were sorting it out and had got the Fraud Department on to it again.Then today they debit the money from my account.When I asked them to Credit it back, they said they don't know and kept me waiting on the phone another half an hour, trying to get hold of the Fraud Department.By this time was absolutely fuming and left the phone, call,  saying, to sort it out. They have no idea about how to handle customers accounts. I've been with them for 10 years and the lack of respect the representative had today was unbelievable.Needless to say I will be moving my account.            
                Terrible bank avoid at all costs, Mobile App is so crap. website crap. Services Crap. AVOID!!!            
                Trying to arrange 2 mortgages, failed to contact me for 4 weeks to arrange interview for one. The other after waiting 4 weeks they say is dependent on the other one - never said this at any point in the process until a month in. Claim to have contacted me but have no record by what means or when. Vendor is going to pull the plug on the purchase. Have been misadvised twice during follow ups. After 18 years with this bank this is the final straw, utter incompetence and indifference to their customers.            
                1. English is not the first language for most of the staffs.  2. When you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they will just blame on the system. 3. They will always say about logging your feedback to the system, yet I have not seen any changes at all. So you might to go online and constantly send in your feedback form, but I still see no significant changes.4. I am an existing customer with HSBC for 6 years. I wanted to get a new card with the contactless features. However, I have to 'upgrade' my account and was told that I am not eligible. I know that all new customers of HSBC despite whatever account they applied, will automatically get a contacless card, unless you said so. So as an existing customer, I was not able to do so and was told that my existing to the system was not worthy. However, I am able to use contactless payment (my HSBC card) with apple pay and yet I am not eligible to get that feature on my card. My conclusion is that don't waste your time with HSBC, try other banks who will offer better deals and services.            
                Worst bank ever. They just decided to "inactivate" our EUR account full of money because there hasn't been any debit in the last 3 months. Despite multiple calls, still can't get access to it.If it was isolated... can't do international transfers after 15:00. All comms is through letters and paper forms to be brought to a branch.Last week they forced us to spend one hour with one of their "specialists" to collect data they already had about our business.Absolutely rubbish service. Will move as soon as I can.            
                THE WORST WORST WORST EXPERIENCE EVER            
                still waiting to setup a business account 2hrs waiting listening to awful musicthe whole process has taken me 2 weeks so far. Don't believe them when they say it's simple, iv had messages left with wrong phone numbers to get back to, they set up my account and I can't get in it as they haven't sent me any of the codes etc,I wrote a letter of complaint and no reply does anyone work at this bank. If I could give it my own rating it would be -3â. ABSOLUTELY APPALLED ð ð¡            
                HSBC - Terrible/Inept Mortgage Service - Despite several promises, they have failed to send a surveyor to a property I am selling.  A heap of excuses, requesting information they already have from our buyers etc.  Is it really that difficult to pick up the phone and arrange a survey???????They have held up a housing chain for almost 3 weeks unnecessarily, the chain is in real danger of collapsing if they do not act.  Every time their customer phones and complains, more excuses or false promises.DO NOT USE HSBC - Very Poor service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            
                Very difficult to deal with. Can't do anything in Branch anymore and online, mobile and telephone banking is unfit for purpose. Shocking customer service. Security keys don't work. Little reward for loyal customers. All round appalling bank to deal with.            
                Called HSBC on 17/05/2017 and got thru to what was a call centre in India. Made a bank transfer and I asked if a Â£300 and odd pound DD had left my acct and was advised that it had, however when I checked my acct today it was Â£300 and odd pounds less than what I had been advised. I called the bank back again today 18/05/2017 @ 13.22 and asked why I was given false information, I got thru to India again and after repeating myself over and over (GUESS WHAT) YES I GOT CUT OFF. As a result of this I will certainly be leaving this bank and taking my business elsewhere. AWFULL customer service and totally unacceptable .            
                Working well            
                oh my goodness, what have HSBC done to their internet banking, it's awful!  i just want to see my statement and it's so confusing.  I've opened another account with a different bank as this is just silly.            
                Don't waste your time with this bank!! What a load of rubbish! Money goes out of my account for days they don't know where it's gone then it lands back in my account! Money goes leaving me with a - balance when I -shouldn't have had anything leave my account! I only have 2 DDs set up so how this happens is beyond me! Rubbish app, can't do the things on it that you should be able to do! Simple things like send money/ set payments up! Full online banking system is just as bad. Stupid format, for balance/available balance, the way it updates, it's the first time I've ever seen it done the way these idiots do it. the online statements are so confusing it's unreal! The thing is just crap, needs to catch up with the times. Really need to change banks before these robdogs fully have me!! AVOID.AVOID.AVOID            
                They give out loans that have been banned from in 1995 absolutely and utterly horrid the people on the phone can't even properly speak English and they are just a bunch of scams from a Â£5000 loan they took Â£10000 .They don't even have a proper insurance that compensates the loss of money that had been taken without permission.            
                Please do yourself a favour and not get suckered into switching to this bank because of offers like Â£200 when you switch. It takes them so long to send paperwork out that you never have a chance of switching within the 30 day deadline. I have now sent 6 emails to customer services to complain and received the same template email in response each time about how 'a member of the team will look into this' and they inevitably don't.            
                Hsbc business banking is the worst one in the market... I experienced atleast 20 times this one below in the past years with them...If your business account goes overdrawn over the limit and you deposit that amount in the branch to stay within the limits to make sure that all the cheque payments goes through; you have to call their relevant team and say that you are within the limit, they will say that after 4pm the computer is controlling it and they can't override it! Surely a computer can see that it's within the limit and wont let the cheques to bounce and charge you for it, if it was within the limit before the bank closing time!!!!You pay for business account and tbey say that they got business team to look after you but in the real fact you are paying for some dumm computer...            
                They freeze my debit card every week, sometimes even twice a week. I am so frustrated with this corporation, I can't even be civil to the representatives on the phone even though they aren't the ones driving this bus. I've incurred so many late fees from personal memberships, cancelled orders from online purchases as a result of them just 'freezing' my account at any given moment without warning, that I'm ready to close out my accounts and take my business elsewhere. They are the worst.            
                I have been a HSBC customer for the past 15 years, but over the past 5 years the service offered has significantly degraded to the point of not being fit for purpose. Recently I had a fraudulent transaction on my account which meant I had to deal with customer services (still not sure why this couldn't have been done over secure message within online banking) and had to face over one hour being on hold and still not getting through. I raised a first complaint which was ignored and finally through my second complaint and the threat of escalating to the Financial Ombudsman I did get through to someone who had some common sense and was able to resolve my issue - after 3 months of chasing and crediting the fraudulent party.If you are looking to open an account with HSBC, my advice is don't, there are many other banks out there - even FirstDirect which is part of the HSBC Group and has UK based customer service - I don't understand why the reputation is still so high as it really shouldn't be. I am in the process of moving my account away from HSBC as I no longer have confidence in them.            
                I rang today with a simple question about my bank the lady on the phone was no help at all, complete wast of my time, she had no idea what she was doing. Talking to her was very frustrating she would avoid my questions. Please put someone one the line that can actually help. I mean it's meant to be a helpline but it's far from helpful.            
                The customer service on the phone is non existant. I'm currently in a queue and have been for the last 35mins. This is the 3rd call at 20mins + before giving up. Even the busiest little firm would of picked up by now. I truly believe it's a tactic designed to grind you down. If the matter wasn't that important i would of given up. Honestly the only person manning the line is the recorded message " Thank you for holding. Our Customer service agents are aware...Just got through! What a waste of effing time.Not only was i straining to understand what the agent had to say,(  the reason i phoned up was to dispute transactions coming out of my 14 yr old son's account), but she wanted to take the 1 credit he'd received off the bank, (in recognition that it was fraudulent), i ended up telling her i didn't want it taken off him again. She asked what i'd like her to do, (it was very tempting to say what i thought), but i just said forget this phone call ever happened and not take any more money or action. Because of this they will not stop any more transactions from the account.I'll be taking his account my elsewhere..            
                HSBC Philippines is the worst bank ever. If theres an option I will give you zero. My card got approved late 2016. I requested for cash advance pin so i can enrol my account online. After 7 months and 9th times of follow you would just tell me the same reasons why I am not receiving it. That you have a courier problem? Really that long? You offered me an installment plan and promised to be approved after 5 banking days. As usual not really true. After 7 days still on process. Youre so unrealiable.            
                I have tried to contact HSBC to arrange an appointment at the BURY branch. No matter what time of day you call waiting times are 20 to 25 minutes cannot get through .  The service is horrendous .   I have also sent them a message and they responded by asking what the appointment was for when I clearly stated this on the message .  Plus they have charged me for this particular service due to no fault of my own .   Once this is sorted , I'll be canceling my account .            
                Probably, the worst online banking system in the world. Does not work if you use safari, apple or generally, any computer operating system. Try applying for a mortgage- it will take you months!            
                An absolute crap hole. Customer service is atrocious! They'll always make you wait and when one of their advisers finally comes to see you they'll treat you like a piece of meat.            
                still waiting to setup a business account 20mins waiting listening to awful musicthe whole process has taken me 2 weeks so far.  Don't believe them when they say it's simple            
                1 star is too many. Similar problems to what others have complained about. Useless people on the help line, useless people on location. Actually, one time a bank manager did call me back to explain why my account was changed. He was helpful in reversing a transaction when I was informed that the account I transferred money too was no longer valid. You think that would have been brought to my attention a year or 2 before I found out...Poor overall acceptance for HSBC visa debit cards too.  When the bank card debit visa does work, it's only useful for some websites. No rhyme nor reason for why some work and others don't.HSBC cancels my bank card repeatedly without informing me. They've eveb changed my account type without informing me.  And they canceled my foreign cash card... again without telling me! Notice a pattern? Maybe someone with a brain could explain this to the dummies at HSBC in Taiwan. Oh and I was once told when inquiring about a small personal loan that HSBC doesn't give loans to foreigners without a local cosignee... even if the foreigner has permanent residency,  a good job and credit. Try doing that in North America and not being accused of political incorrectness...Good thing foreigners don't need  loans or to use their bank cards on vacation eh!?!Cuz surprise canceled cards is always convenient...Normally I wouldn't agree with the harsh rhetoric that all bankers belong in the ground. But in this case, it actually might help the world. At least there, the donkeys running the clown show at HSBC would be more useful than they are now. Not too much longer before I transfer all of my money out of this awful bank and use a credit union. So many reasons I recommend to go elsewhere.  Or just put your money in a sock drawer.The sock drawer will be more helpful and not as stupid.HSBC ~ Worst bank ever. The world's  International bank.... lol, That's a joke. Total garbage service and policy.            
                Thank you Tomi for a wonderful experience at this branch. We have been treated so well and had every one of our needs attended to. A weight was lifted off of us today. Thank you for making this difference with such fantastic service. Well done! We are impressed.            
                The new HSBC Internet Banking interface is terrible. I am not sure who approved the design. For a start, it is extremely difficult to navigate through the screens. One would struggle to go back to balance/ account information. In total very bad experience.            
                OMG where to start. I tried to open a bank account for my son who is 13 years old. He is eager to start saving and budgeting his money like an adult. I am with First Direct but unfortunately they do not do child accounts so had to go with HSBC. This choice was mainly out of convenience as I call in each month to pay money my into first direct account, and thought if my kid had anything saved I could pay that in for him too. Anyway we both went into the branch in Oldham on 13th April 2017. 17 days later (5th May 2017) they still hadn't got around to clearing the account for approval? In that time we received no correspondence to say how things where progressing, nothing, niche, SWEET FA, not even an e mail or anything. When I rang though, all my child's details were on their computer system.? SO HOW can it take so long?????? We weren't asking for a million pound overdraft,  a half a million pound mortgage or a billion pound loan. It was a child's bank account!!! AN ACCOUNT WHERE HE CAN'T SPEND ANYTHING HE HASN'T GOT.  How difficult is it??????Its not even like they are the best bank out there, offering rates that knock your eyeballs out and I only tried to place my kid with them purely for convenience, I wish I hadn't bothered, they are a nightmare. Rude and obnoxious in the branch and on the phone well don't go there.I tried to speak to them twice (on day 15 of the 'Wait' and then day 17) One bloke told he saw the account it just needed clearing and told me he would put an 'urgent' on the account. When I rang two days later to see how it was progressing I got people from Singapore or China on???. They didn't understand English and it was just hard work. I think they thought because I was asking about the account I was somehow trying to do something fraudulent. Jesus Wept, I only wanted to know if the account was open SEVENTEEN days after my 13 year old son had had gone in to the branch in OLDHAM.  In the end I was just rude and told them to shove it and slammed the phone down. They are crap basically.  I am trying somewhere else. I'm a little annoyed as they have wasted my kids time and if the account comes through I will cut the card up, but I do think they've done my kid a favour in the end. Everything they say about them in the press you can understand why. Jesus can you imagine trying to get a mortgage from them. OMG NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO            
                If I could give hsbc 0 I really would. Quite possibly the worst customer service team I've ever encounted. You spend ages on hold for your call to be answered by someone who can't assist you. I've had an ongoing dispute since March and still not has been done to resolve this, other banks with block transactions no not hsbc free money for all. You allowed someone to take my money and no I want it back its a problem. Worst bank and customer service team in the world!!!!! Ram in the disputes team promises a lot but can't back it up.            
                So where to begin! The website has issues opening and when after 10 mins you get it to open it has "unexpected errors" and is unable to open any statements or setup direct debits or anything. Personally I find the errors very expected.  First you have to review if you want to go paperless YET AGAIN as you open  up the website and have no option to even say NO YET AGAIN until after you have been forced to look at the statement list you did not want to change and then are forced to confirm you decision YET AGAIN. Then there is the idiot who put the live chat button in the way of you looking at your balances and transactions instead of placing it on the empty space in the bottom left corner so you can choose to use it if you want instead of it butting in all the time. Of course if you do press it it has an error message so won't work.The fact that the website feedback button does not function either as they obviously don't want to know how useless the website is. Don't even bother trying to use the contact or help buttons they won't function either. Finally you are forced to contact a call centre full of staff who do not understand HSBC is a bank not a building society as one told me today let alone what they need to do for their job so there is no hope of them understanding the issues that are on the website. Eventually they will log a call although don't hold your breath that anyone will contact you or that any of the issues will be looked at.            
                I've been with HSBC for about 12 years and never really had any issues. Yes, their customer services are based abroad but I tend to find the agents helpful and can usually speak English well enough to be able to help me with problems I've had, such as lost cards, fraud refunds, or making sure I can use my debit card abroad (which I did without issue). They've been stable through the financial crises and I never felt concerned about my money.The only time I ever had an ongoing problem was when a very small amount would go out of my account monthly... which would trigger their fraud detection and block my card... and no matter how many times I told them the transaction was fine and regular, it just kept happening... but at least they'd very quickly unblock my card again. Only really got resolved when I cancelled that payment.I find their latest online banking system fairly intuitive and have never had any difficulties using it or their banking app. The only reason I'm leaving now and giving them 4 stars not 5, is that they don't offer much in the way of reward current accounts so after A LOT of deliberation and research, I've just begun the process of swapping to another bank with 5% interest on my balance. HSBC only offers that interest on their Regular Saver account which is not instant access so kind of useless to me. Honestly though, if they could have mostly matched the current account rewards, I would have stayed but they really don't seem to reward loyalty... as I watched my savings interest plummet with no incentive from them elsewhere... but I guess that's most banks these days.            
                I have been with this bank for 21 years and it has only been the past 3 months where I have experienced problems with online banking and calling customer services. If you cannot remember a payment that has come out of your account they cease the call and say they cannot help you further. I have been locked out of my online banking despite putting in the same details as always it locked me out, a few phone calls and one online chat to see if anyone can help, but because I couldn't tell them the 30.00 or 72.50 made on my account they wouldn't help. One lady put the phone down on me. Online chat couldn't help because I coukdnt log into my online account for them to help. A supervisor tried calling me 3times on my mobile to try and help me but my phone wouldn't ring and went straight into voicemail even though I physically had the phone in my hand waiting for her call. Since her third attempt she hasn't tried again. I tried to explain to one advisor she was trying to ring me and would they transfer the to her but apparently they can't do that they must have terrible technology/phones not being able to do that.  This is my second time with poor customer service with HSBC. It's my money so I should be able to access it. Disgusting.            
                Since the launch of the now infamously terrible new website, I have been unable to set up recurring standing orders. Is this just me or is everyone else having the same problem too? I doubt it's just me, and HSBC did say there was an ongoing issue with setting up recurring standing orders, but it's strange that such a significant problem would not have been fixed yet and that I can't find any corroboration on google(?)Either way, this has really been the last straw, and unfortunately - after 25 years of banking with Midland Bank / HSBC - I have moved my account elsewhere. This was something I would never have done until the new website as I had never had any problems before.            
                Horrendous customer service - numerous telephone calls having to explain over and over and over again the same points. So frustrating.... Promises of call backs that NEVER. Materialise . Totally fed up now with waiting hours on the phone with annoying over familiar customer service staff. Will take my significant funds elsewhere.            
                I don't have time to tell you how bad they are, just trust me. JESUS H CHRIST.....The back office system was designed by monkeys dressed in clown outfits on acid. Appallingly bad. If you want to start a business double your work load by starting with HSBC. They couldn't hit a cow on the backside with a banjo. I have spoken to many directors who use them and they all sing the same tune. A colossal mess of a bank. RUN for the bloody hills!!! Incompetence at the highest level!!            
                Most shocking experience of "customer service" I have ever received from a bank. The staff I dealt with in branch are unknowledgable, unhelpful and rude, and my email complaint has had no response in over a week. Will no longer be banking with them and am happy to take my business and money elsewhere.            
                Well after making the mistake of switching for the Â£150 bonus  ( which of course never gets paid) I am now in the hand of a British bank where noone seems to speak English .  All their call centre must be overseas and it is so frustrating.  I cant understand them and they cant understand me  so we go around in circles .  NIGHTMARE            
                As soon as monzo offers overdrafts i'm moving fully across..Wanted to check whether someone had sent me money but had forgot my internet banking password(as i never use it as the mobile app is crap).So i ended up calling customer service who were nice but quickly asked to call me back and then didn't for 4 hours while i waited for them to.. Then when he did he hung up randomly within 2 minutes..            
                The HSBC online and mobile banking is the most complicated one I have ever tried, a disgrace!            
                Been with HSBC fior over 30yrs. Applied for a Â£45000 mortgage over 10 years on a property worth approx Â£780000 . REFUSED. !! Offered me Â£10000 on line . Why? We are both 56yrs old employed and earn in excess of Â£50000 . Feel age against us disgraceful HSBC you should be ashamed.            
                I find the staff in the branch and on the phone pretty good and efficient. However, the website is truly terrible and Im almost at the stage of not bothering with it at all. today, ive tried to set up a manual pasyment to my credit card, provided by HSBC. It doesnt work with NO explanation or indication of either what Ive done wrong, or that it just desnt work now, for some other reason. Acouple of days ago I tried to transfer balances from other cards, as I had received an offer; online a no no. Had to phone and take 10-15 mins to complete the switch. Come back Barclaycard all is forgiven!!            
                Their technology is extremely poor which makes any time of admin very time consuming.            
                After 20 years, I have decided to leave HSBC.I have had nothing but grief for the last 3-4 of years. Blocking my card CONTINUOUSLY for no reason, not being able to get cash out of local ATMs, not being able to do online shopping with companies I have shopped with for 5+ years, every time I try to do online banking there seems to be a 'technical glitch', so I have to call them, calling them to tell them I'm going abroad, only to find my card blocked, when trying to pay in said country/city, and the never-ending calls, calls, and more calls, that I am forced to make, that have cost me a fortune (last call was over an hour, and nothing NOTHING was resolved, they offered me 33 GBP compensation for my 2 years of calling them and complaining about nonsense that should have never happened in the first place - I felt absolutely insulted) only to have everything above mentioned, happen over and over and over again, every couple of months.I am completely exhausted, disgusted and repulsed by their customer service, care and attitude. There are so many better options out there, bye bye HSBC, go torture somebody else, I quit.            
                Waits of up to an hour for the telephone serviceVery poor online service with glitches in their messaging and Money transfer systems.Poor local street banking hours with no weekend service.Overall experience very poor            
                We were with  HSBC/Midland for over 40 years but no more. The stupid amount of security for the online banking drove me round the bend. As as for telephoning forget it. They asked me questions which i could not possibly answer so I was effectively totally locked out of our account. I had to make a long journey (my local branch had been closed... say no more) to close the account. Nationwide is much more user friendly            
                AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!We have had our HSBC account for more than 20 years (From the Midland Bank days). We've had a Mortgage with them for about 5 years now which the in-branch mortgage advisor was very helpful with. We now need to relocate and decided to deal with them over the phone as it has become impossible to get an appointment in branch since they have closed a lot of their branches. It has been 2 months since we submitted all the paperwork and nothing!It is almost impossible to get hold of our mortgage advisor and it seems that she is avoiding us on purpose. I cannot contact her directly and she does not respond to any emails and they refuse to give me a direct contact number. I call the mortgage helpline about 3 or 4 times a week and get the same line every time. "We will send her an email and copy in her line manager" I have raised several complains and have about three letters asking me if I am satisfied with the resolution thereof when nothing seems to have come from any of them.Their communication is utterly dismal, frustrating and aggravating. Our vendors are talking about pulling out as things don't seem to be progressing and our buyers are pushing for a completion date.As per usual I was promised a call back a week ago and I have still not been able to speak to an advisor, despite two emails and several calls to them.I will be severing all ties to HSBC as soon as possible and will be advising all who wants to hear to AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!            
                Awful. They sent a debit card to the wrong address and then proceeded to tell me it was my fault. It took 2 hours on the phone and still no resolution. They couldn't care less about customers, steer clear            
                Im very dissapointed beyond words they really should give the option of no stars because giving them one star feels to genrous. Me and my fiance applied for a personal loan online recieved the paperwork through and was accepted signed the paperwork and returned it we didnt hear anything for 10 days called them up and they said that my fiance signature didnt match and they would send the paperwork back out so my fiance signed and returned it only to be told again in a week that they didnt receive it so we went in the leigh branch took our id in and my fianced signed the paperwork there and then the assistant told us that everything will be fine now and it will be a couple of days this is once again a week ago my fiance as phoned up again only to be told they haven't got it to anyone applying for a personal loan save yourself the time and effort and go somewhere much better hsbc is terrible  its been over 3 week its ridiculous            
                I have read some of the reviews on here and can only corroborate what others have said. The process to go through to simply start up an online Business Bank account is absolutely shocking. A month down the line and we still do not have the account opened yet. Two weeks into the process, I was asked to amend my name on Companies House (from my abbreviated name I have used for the last 30 years and have never had a bank question, to my full birth name). The joke of this is, when I ring and use my abbreviated name, they pass me through security quite happily! I did this, at a cost, and two weeks later I ring up to find what has been going on and low and behold I get the same answer as every other time I ring them, 'I will be called back within 24 hours to discuss it'. Even though the 'team' that always rings and leaves a message to say 'please ring us back in the following number' when you ring back, you can never actually talk to them! Instead, after always queuing for at least 15 minutes, the person you end up speaking to is nothing more than a glorified mesaging service, who will always tell you there is no one available to talk too!The list is endless when it comes to incompetency with this HSBC department, and I wish I had read this post before I started this process, all in all a nightmare and I fear what appeared to be a simple process st the beginning will turn in to a more and more complicated process which will no doubt end in a trip to my local branch - exactly what I was trying to avoid by starting the process online in the first place.Best advice to anyone considering opening a new account with HSBC - Avoid Like the Plague!!!!!            
                By far the worst service I've ever had - I wont bore you with the details because I'd be here all week. In short, if you value your time and sanity, avoid starting up a bank account of any kind with HSBC like the plague. It appears they've made cut-backs to staffing, whilst failing to adapt their operations, resulting in a sh1t storm of delays and incompetence.            
                I have never had such bad Internet Banking experiences as I have had since they changed their on line banking system.  Each time I have logged on the screen will freeze and I have to close down and start again.  It is so user unfriendly that it takes for ever to navigate the system, and to find what you are looking for.  This is a bank I have been with (formerly the Midland) for over 40 years, and it is now the worst Internet experience I have. I dread having to log on to do my Internet banking.            
                The worst bank ever, they held the payment for my house without any reasons for weeks, putting me in financial losses and difficulties as a result. Useless and have no corporate procedures they cannot handle SWIFT payments USELESS. DO NOT USE            
                I am with HSBC for last 6 years and the service was fantastic. They have even upgraded my account to advance account.The customer support was really good and I would strongly recommend HSBC to my friends.            
                The new HSBC online banking is a disaster. The old version was so much better and easier to use. The new one only shows 3 pending transactions and you can't see anymore. To set up a new payee is a nightmare. Took me the best part of an hour to do it. Whereas in the old version 5 minutes and it was done. Don't know what they thinking when they designed it. They are now saying they are going to change the app too. Well I look forward to seeing that destroyed too. I have opened an account with TSB and the online banking is a joy to work with. HSBC get your act together and sort it out!            
                Awful online experience - site rarely works, and when it does you need more security pins for everything despite already being logged in. Even to write the idiots in customer services an email because its hard to speak to anyone you need to security fob despite being logged in. The phone app is useless, you can see your balance and that is about it. How is it all my other bank apps you can log in easily, set up transfers and payments and its effortless. Every time I do and international transfer with these guys my money goes missing and I have to chase it up with customer services, and its usually stuck in security. Its a joke!! Get a grip HSBC!!!            
                This has been the worst banking experience I have ever witnessed. They make everything so complicated...About me: I am a German Expat in the US. For foreigners, it is quite difficult to be approved for a Credit Card since there is no credit history. I am with this bank for 6 months now and I am thinking of just ripping my credit card and cancelling my accounts. For every new customer to this bank: NOTHING will work the first time. Not the delivery of your credit card, the address entered in your account, bill bay, bank to bank transfer,... The online-banking website will pop up with some security checks you never received documents for so you cannot actually do it. Then you have to call the customer service - and I tell you - it is the worst. After waiting in line for ten minutes (even with the Advance Account), they connect you with an operator with often very poor English skills (I say that as a non-native speaker). And then the journey begins. You will have to re-confirm your identity. And that is not done by one question, but takes another ten minutes. Then you state your problem (i.e. I cannot move any money) and they say "Ohhh, for this we have to redirect you to the security office". So you are redirected to another operator, have to wait in line again and reconfirm your identity again. No kidding!! I wanted them to send me the security code the other day (which I have never received), and they wanted me to re-confirm the address they send it to. So I told them my address including the apartment number. Guess what the person said (in terrible English): "Oh, your apartment number is not on our file, we have to re-connect you to security office"... That's when I hung up. Another time I bought a car and wanted to pay the upfront sum, of course, we had a problem again. They blocked the payment since the system flagged it as fraudulent activity or whatsoever. I had to call the call center (with the sales person sitting next to me) and that took 45 minutes. Whenever you have even the simplest issues (even made up issues by them) you will have to call the "customer service"... Each time of 40-60 minutes of clueless people who actually do not help. I don't need this problem making in my spare time. Banking should be easy, it is just moving money, but what they made out of it is just a terrible experience. I have an appointment with another bank tomorrow. I will probably not be approved for a credit card, but whatever. Everything is better that this mess!            
                Just received letter in last few days that HSBC CLOSING my 2 accounts ,currents  and savings I've been with this bank most of my life and I've been a loyal customer , never done anything wrong !!!! The only activity on my accounts is my wages being paid in every week , then most of my money is spent in the 4 main supermarkets .I feel really upset and hurt .My m&s card has also been closed because this is part of hsbc I've had that card since 1988 and the man on phone there could not understand why my account was being closed !! Also my first direct accounts being closed also owned by HSBC .This is a very unfair decision the bank has made because whatever information they have on me and my family it is very wrong !! I am a very honest hard working person and I feel very distressed and upset by this ,and will be taking it further.I have been with HSBC I was a child when it was the Midland Bank nearly 40 years ,i am so upset and hurt by what they have done it has really depressed me as there is absolutely no reason for what they have done !!!!            
                online banking is horrendously overcomplicated.People want easy, user friendly yet they give the opposite; whoever designed their website wants shooting.            
                Unable to log in or perform simple functionalityThe app is pathetic. The website asks to select generate security key option on the app which is not available. I'm stuck in a loop with 3 - 4 different passwords, keys, memorable informations to remember.Why other banks can make internet banking easy and effortles while HSBC has created such a painful experience?I'm closing my account.            
                Unorganised, rude, full of errors and glitches, unsafe, do not deal with them. From multiple cards sent out, wrong addresses, blocked account for no reason, multiple dongles....one would think as a Premier customer you would get a decent treatment, how wrong. Never did they ever treat us as a customer let alone premier. They had our money for years and when it came to opening a simple business account could not shake themselves and be of assistance.  I am swapping banks today, after 3 years of agony.            
                The list of errors from HSBC in the last 2 years of being a joint account holder with my partner is ridiculous. Their sheer incompetence is staggering. I'll list a few examples:1)customer services cancelled our overdraft accidently and then started charging us for being  overdrawn we got the money back and overdraft facility but only after a trip to the bank and several phone calls. We're promised a hamper as apology but never arrived as someone forgot to approve it.2) cancelled debit card again accidently 3) sent multiple plastic secure keys as a replacement leaving me no idea which one I could actually use.4)kept sending new bank cards ect to the branch for security reasons even though I had already had already had one sent to the house.5) repeated problems with online banking the secure key feature is a huge pain in the rear and just for that reason alone I would nevery bank with HSBC.6) lost card and was told a replacement would arrive in 5 working days phoned after 5 working days was told it could be 6 working  days. Phoned after 6 working  days and was told it had never been sent. A new one would be sent . 2 days later a card arrives. Activate card Go and do a food shop, go to pay. Card doesn't work. Turns out to be the card I was told was never ordered was the one that arrived. Unfortunately I only found this out after I requested a new pin as I thought that was the problem and I had forgotten my pin. At no point did customer services put 2 and 2 together as I wondered what was going on. And stood outside shop with 3 kids. Still have no bank card 2 weeks later7) took down wrong phone number so when I was trying to set up online banking the secure texts weren't coming through. Took 3 calls and for me to finally realise it wasn't a fault with my phone or their computers it was they had incorrectly taken my contact number when I'd set up the account.They are truly awful. It's a right pain to change everything over to another bank but that's what I'm doing now. Final note people in branch I can't fault it's what goes in the call centres and administration side of HSBC absolute shambles            
                There are visible bugs in the website normal functions.Site keep on crashing - wait/load overlays, blank pages, sorry pages.Web Chat suggest to log-off and login again without hesitation.Even the last IB site was better than this- no doubt. I wasted more than 30 min for a normal payment which should took 2 minutes.            
                I have been with them over 15 years and many of my friends told me dont use hsbc as they can shut your account down for no reason they will not offer you mortgage as their underwriters are useless, they work from 10am till 3pm and most of time they spent on mobile!!!! and thats just true they are simply useless declined application for no reason, I will move my business from them soon no point giving them money            
                I've been with HSBC for around 26 years and have been in full time employment in all that time. I have no CCJs or bad debts.They gave me a credit card limit of Â£12,500 (I did not request that much) and an overdraft of Â£5500.I stupidly ran up both of these to their limits. I take full responsibility for my stupid actions in doing this. However, when I realised I had got myself into trouble, and at a time that they are advertising loan rates as low as 3.3% - the best rate they would give me on a consolidation loan was 16%. I feel they have acted like loan sharks and hung me out to dry. I am in turmoil and cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel with the massive loan I have now taken out which will take 7 years to pay off, and leave me with very little money. They do not care about customers or behaving in a fair and reasonable manner or taking some responsibility themselves for lending me more than I could afford.            
                The worst online banking. The most complicated app. The most patronising customer service albeit trying very hard to be polite. And I have accounts with 5 other banks. HSBC gives by all means the worst experience.            
                If you want to get 10 paper letters requesting bizarre information from you over 7 weeks in the single attempt to open a current account.... think again.The only reason I was switching was the sign up bonus and 5% monthly savings rate - guess what, they didn't actually switch my accounts to begin with and told me I haven't requested it - it's very handy to have 0 balance.Don't even waste your time.            
                Only been with HSBC for about 3 weeks,and i'm switching back to my old bank.Their online banking system is horrible!! and their customer service is even worse!Avoid!            
                The latest changes are a disgrage.            
                Trying to call HSBC is like a game of smoke and mirrors. The menus are nonsensical and the waiting times crazy. The customer experience is truly appalling - and I've been trying to *open* an account. I can only imagine what things are like once you're on board.            
                I have recently lost my dad who has banked with HSBC (Midlands) for as long as I can remember. Myself and my brother (who are both HSBC account holders) are trying to open an executors account with hsbc. They are by far the most useless, rude, untruthful organisation I have had to deal with ever. Promised calls from the business team who set up the accounts that never happen. Rude staff who have no empathy or compassion... Avoid HSBC like the plaque.....            
                Ten minutes of cell time trying to reach my branch to tell them I'll be late for an appt. Have you ever tried to get a branch number? Some 888 number is any foreign country. Ridiculous. So I'm trying to be polite by calling ahead and end up showing up twenty minutes late and angry as he'll.  Smart customer 'care'.            
                I have been with this company for 38 years but that doesn't matter to them.  I am just another number who they can afford to lose apparently.  I filed a complaint in March 2015 regarding changes made to the forms used for transferring money in online banking.  I have filed several more since then too!  I have had several conversations with numerous people, sent them examples of the errors and all they have managed to do is to make the situation worse, every time, instead of better.  They have given me 'workarounds' in the meantime, which should I forget on any occasion, will lead me down the path of fury yet again.  Whilst I have dealt with a small number of helpful individuals since 2015, I have dealt with considerably more unhelpful, rude, ineffective, progress blocking, script reading, time wasting, untruthful and dare I say imbeciles.  The amount of time one has to spend trying to explain (repeatedly) the issue in order to track down and get back what is rightfully theirs i.e. money lost in transit, is ludicrous.  Why are they not trained to listen, to escalate, to take the initiative or to be proactive? and I'm not just talking about the customer service rep.  They obviously do not have a Process Improvement model.  I'm tired of them, I'm tired of the additional stress they impose on me and the impact they have on my family life.  They asked me how much compensation I want.  Why do they not come up with a figure of what they believe my time, my loyalty as a customer and my inconvenience is worth. At least making me an offer would make me feel as though I, an individual, was being considered. They need to be held accountable!  Ombudsman, here I come.            
                I've been with this bank for 50 years and they never cease to amaze me when they "upgrade" their online offering.Haven't the idiots in IT heard of the saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it"The latest downgrade is the worst yet.Who wants a picture of Hong Kong taking up the majority of the accounts page?When I open my accounts page I want to see a full page of transactions, not just five like they've come up with now.It's a useless waste of space and so impractical. Why should I have to scroll to see anything useful.Customer service is useless and it's years since I used the telephone because I could never understand the agent at the other end. Last time I had to phone (years ago now) the thick accented agent couldn't even comply with my instructions so I had to call again.I gave one star because you can't give LESS.It's time I moved banks.            
                ð¡ words can not fully express how hacked off I am with HSBC . I agree with all the negative comments and as soon as I can locate my substantial missing funds I will be jumping ship to another bank!  Service offered is totally crap and each adviser feeds you a different line. I find the Indian advisers quite condescending and really struggle to understand their accent over the phone - complete nightmare - awful experience over the past few days and no resolution in sight ð­            
                I normally stick for the full year with a new current account and I've been through quite a few over the past years. However, HSBC's online banking makes me want to stab my eyes out on a daily basis and I really cannot put up with this train wreck of a bank any longer. Also it took them 6 weeks to open a sodding bank account, whereas with TSB it was mere seconds! Complete disaster, avoid at all costs!            
                This is not usable, I have suffered ever since they updated last year, first they stoped recognising my passwords and numbers, they asked me questions like "eldest child?" Er I have no children, do you know something I don't? It came down to finger print, that soon stoped working, I was down to fast balance, I went to my branch, tried to sort out all the problems, well it worked at the branch after a frustrating few hours, even they couldn't get it working at first, so problem sorted? No, I'm at home and just tried using it, apparently I have tried and failed too many times........?.......!This service is terrible it just dose t work            
                If you have any accounts with HSBC France then BEWARE. If you are an executor of a will or an inheritor, you will receive no co-operation from this bank, nor will you see the money! Sounds far-fetched? Itâs not â thatâs exactly what has happened to us. After 100 days, 20+ communications by letter, by email, by telephone, and in person â we still do not know details of my motherâs accounts, whether they have been blocked, what interest was paid to those accounts before her death, what the balance of those accounts is, and we have not received a single communication about her private banking account. When you complain they just fob you off, they say they have passed it on to the relevant department and then you hear absolutely nothing. If you call the telephone number they give you for the âsuccessionâ department, nobody ever answers that number. The branch manager where she banked, Mme Le Roux at Mandelieu, doesnât want to know and even M. FranÃ§ois Essertel the Head of Private Banking doesnât want to know. Weâve had to go to the AMF because it is pointless trying to communicate with them.That is HSBC Franceâs idea of good customer service for bereaved families!02/06/17: Still have not received a reply to our solicitors letters almost 6 months ago - still haven't seen a cent of the money that does not belong to them. Contacted AMF - I would say to people don't waste your time - 2 weeks and nothing other than the standard "we have received your communication blah blah". It's got to the stage where my brother is still trying to sort it out in person in-branch - quite frankly I feel we are wasting his time and the only way this is going to be resolved is through a legal process.            
                1hr 45 mins trying to get through to the call centre to sort out their mistake.  Foreign call centre who didn't have access to the account information! Wasn't able to help, was obviously reading from script in which didn't cover the problem. Why can't they have calls centres in the UK staffed by people who can think for themselves and sort things out.  End result will be moving to a bank with a uk call centre and good customer service.            
                No hope whatsoever!!!!!!!!!Even today I sent an e-mail 14/03/2017 only to receive a response out of the office until the 2nd March 2017!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Maybe he has got the sack as most of them in my opinion should do. Totally useless as a bank.When I have time maybe the ombudsman is worth complaining to            
                I've had a current account and a Help To Buy ISA with HSBC for quite some time. I recently found a house to buy and had to close the Help to Buy ISA. What an easy thing do that it should be! I just went to my branch, asked for it to be closed, and the girl in the bank said it would be fine and that I'd receive my closing statement.Turns out that she did it wrong. The balance in the closing statement was negative! She had put in the wrong amount and it looked like I owed money to the bank because of her ineptitude. I tried calling and getting in touch to fix this many times. I spent a whole week trying to reach them about 4 times a day. All I got was people saying that it would be taken care of and that someone would contact me, but nobody did!That was an incredibly shameful customer service. Even when I wanted to pay back the money that wasn't mine, they were utterly horrible at handling such a simple request.In all, I've learned that HSBC is the worst bank I've ever dealt with, and never want to go through that kind of customer service again, so I'll be closing all the bank accounts I've got with them.            
                I have just spend ages trying to pay my credit card bill on the new HSBC online web page. This new interface is appalling! I wonder who on earth thought that this was an improvement. Bring back the old well-structured interface. This one is a complete disaster.            
                Applied for a credit card for which I was accepted. HSBC sent all paperwork by snail mail (must be the only bank in the world to do still do this!). Had nothing but hassle trying to get in touch, online banking is beyond useless and I keep getting hung up on when I ring! Absolute joke.            
                We've been trying to open an account at HSBC South Kensington branch for our two teenagers aged 13 and 15 since January 17th (7 weeks now) and have met with indifference and incompetence at every turn.We've had to wait over an hour on each visit (two hours on one occasion) just to speak with anyone about the process (first enquiring; then handing over docs; then having to ask why no card had arrived). Meanwhile, HSBC call centre staff won't accept instructions from the children's mother - they insist they can only deal with the account holder (even though they're in school, don't fully understand the complexities of HSBC's application system or have their own documents proving address etc).We have also had the following problems: *  when, after long delay, a debit card did arrive for our son, the surname on it was spelt wrong (HSBC's mistake - it was correct on the form we submitted) *  no debit card arrived at all for our daughter and, when queried about this, HSBC said they couldn't fit the surname on it (even though they'd successfully achieved this feat - albeit misspelt - for our son's) *  having finally received a correctly spelt card for our son, no pin number arrived - and still hasn't. SEVEN WEEKS after our first visit to HSBC South Kensington branch, our son's account is still not yet operative!! It's so stunningly, amazingly incompetent, you almost want to laugh.Given that large numbers of people stay with the same bank all their lives (if this is still true) you'd think that a bank would be interested in facilitating two young customers wishing to open accounts. Not HSBC. I'm all for giving up on them and going to Lloyds, but my wife says she's spent so many hours trying to get this done she doesn't want to feel she's wasted all her time. AVOID!!!!            
                I don't understand the negative opinions, I like the new interface- it's modern, quick and easy. Well done you guys!            
                Why it seemed like a good idea - who knows ; perhaps HSBC have too many customers and asked a developer to find a way to annoy them so much they might leave . So the new web interface was born....bombs out but remains (insecurely! ) connected and prevents easy payment to existing  payees - as well as looking pretty S@!T - but hey , what do customers know. After over 30 years - this might finally tip the balance ; so many 'challenger' banks out there after our custom . Time to try one ?            
                This review is re the new website. In total agreement with the vast majority, what used to take a 15-20 minutes to complete a months worth of transactions can now take up to 2 hours.In agreement with several others on this review site I woud give a Zero 0 rating if possibleBRING BACK THE OLD WEB SITE PLEASE....Its pointless asking this as it falls on deaf ears. HSBC staff involved with this dreadful web site think the sun shines out of its proverbial and all is sweetness and light, all is well with the world...Meanwhile back in the real world its us online customers that have to put up with an awful tool            
                Hsbc were fantastic when I was a student and graduate 10 years ago.  You cant get through on customer services for ages, I have been complaining about this for over 6 months with broken promises of this will improve, the online banking system is over complicated, when it worked fine before.  Have no idea what is going on with this bank.  Went to see them about a mortgage and they had more interest in selling me products than actually sorting out what I went in for.  I have been with this bank for over 20 years and at last I have seen the light and switched.  Best thing I ever did.  Nice change to actually be able to contact a branch when needed, not wait on phone for ages (why should you?)  not get charged extortionate fees for going Â£1 overdrawn!!!.  Nice to be with a bank that actually value their customers.  I know is a hassle but my advice is switch while you can, I guarantee you wont regret it            
                I can not believe that HSBC will have paid software idiots change what was a perfectly acceptable user interface. Now if I just want to look at and print my latest transactions its spread over several screens with pluses and minuses instead of normal statement type presentation. Printing the transactions takes 3 times as much paper and is quite frankly horrible! It doesn't end there! Everything is much more awkward! Please give me the old interface back!            
                F k you and all your services HSBC, I h a t e you , I d a m n h a t e you, I have started a 3000usd transfer from my uk account to my OWN US account!i did it on 28 dec 2016, so I can enjoy it for my new year holidays!guess what, its 2 March 2017, and I STILL DON't have my money!!!from the moment they got my money they sent a letter and suddenly the customer service become NON ENGLISH from YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF THE WORLD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I had called them 28 times, begging for them to return my money, I just canceled the transfer but guess what, they are now saying they have to reconvert the money!!I H A T E HSBC FOREVER as soon I get my money I WILL QUIT THIS BANK FOREVER , FFFFFFFFF UUUUUUUUU FOREVER I HATE YOU!            
                Simple online payment to one of my friends (new payee) genuinely took me 35mins. Not first time. I'm afraid but changing my bank is a consideration.            
                terrible digital experience, terrible customer support, worst bank I've ever been with!            
                Time is valuable and HSBC have had such a significant decline in the two main services1. Telephone banking - You can wait up to 45 min to speak to someone2 . Internet banking - They had a basic but robust system and now they have upgraded it and its not user friendly and very confusing. What would have taken you 2 mins to take care of on online banking now takes double the time to figure out their stupid website.I have just opened up an account with Metrobank and the service is unbelievable.            
                And you can't revert back to the old site which presented sufficient information in a clear and logical way. You could have more than 2 transactions on the screen when you log on! And more than 5 transactions without the need for more clicks and more scrolling. I've been with HSBC for a long time & I am now looking at the competition as I hope the others can't be this bad with internet banking!            
                Usablility of new online banking is much worse than before. The old site worked pretty well, and there was no need to change it. There should at least be an option to return to the old style page.            
                Switched to HSBC from TSB, purely for the Â£150. Cannot wait to leave now. I rely hugely upon internet banking and their site is not fit for purpose. A simple task, no exaggeration, can take 30 mins plus after the constant crashing and clunkiness. I have tried on several PCs and so the problem does not lie with my computer. Awful.            
                HSBC banking services are deteriorating over last couple of years. HSBC staffs are in denial & they believe every thing is perfect.I have been with them for about 11 years & used to phone them every couple of years when I faced a banking problem.Nowadays, I have to phone them couple of times every months at least. Most of their staffs are unexperienced, can not sort out my banking issues, long wait to get hold of one of their agents.Today it took me 31 minutes in total to speak with two agents with a very difficult to understand Indian accent & they did not solve the problem.It is nightmare to continue banking with them. It is waste of time & money to deal with such bank & its inefficient staffs            
                letter from  "Advocate-Customer Care Team" dated 10/2/17 is totally inconsistent with the truth that the "CHAT online staff" give you on their "2 minute" opening.  I shall be going to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Apparently as "I was not a regular user of Online Banking I was 'migrated' despite the true facts which HSBC hold"Their COMPLAINTS TEL. NO. IS NOT FREE.    I wonder who makes money out of this ???The so called tutorial for the" instant new change"  is joke that can only come from an untrained confidence trickster who failed to inform me of their so called  "fresher feel fiasco"I SHALL DEFINITELY BE " EMIGRATING"  from HSBC            
                After having to chase them 3 times to process my "7 day switch" they finally set up my account. Now I find that their website is woeful. I've had to reset my login details 10 times in the last 2 weeks. It won't accept the details I know are correct, then when I try to reset them and use these details it tells me I can't use them as they are the current ones....so why won't you let me use them to log in?????This actual switch happened on Wednesday. This morning (Friday) I've applied to return to Lloyds. They've already attached my new account to my previous online portal and are transferring me back on March 6th.I'll lose the Â£150 switching bonus, but that's a small price to pay for my sanity.HSBC - If you're going to close branches you need  to make sure your website is up to the job.            
                If it were any other business in any other field, if they were as bad as HSBC  you would have Airlines with no seating, Hotels with no beds, the customer service is so bad that it surpasses anything previously encountered including French shop assistants they must have been trained by Slovenian civil servants. I banked with these idiots for 8 years never an overdraft only a debit card Â£350000 pound profit a year . Not 1 phone call from someone to see if we needed anything. The manager never answered the phone once in 8 years of trying to call him. Then they closed our accounts no reason !!!! Defies belief . And they make 2 billion profit this is an easy business I am in the wrong game obviously            
                New website is better in some respects but the transaction list is not segregated into 2 columns of credits and debits making them very hard to read . They are not even colour coded for readability!  Why can't the online transactions look like a normal paper statement which is easy to read ? Come on HSBC - you can do better than this .A disappointed Premier customer            
                Tried to talk to someone for over an hour this morning, been through security twice and now I have to wait another 25mins for someone to answer the telephone. Tried all over the weekend online without success.Service is appalling , I've had enough, transferring investments.            
                Where do you start?I have been with HSBC since 1959 (Midland Bank), now preparing to switch banks to anyone who has a decent on-line banking set-up.* Drop downs that vanish the moment you scroll the page.* Having to scroll 4/5 times to make each payment.* Payments flipping from one account to another.* Debit and credits in the same statement columns.* Regular freezing of the page.* Not being able to make payments in spite of adequate funds.* Stored payees vanishing with time wasted having to re-open them.I could go on and on.... But do you know the worst thing - and I have complained on numerous occasions to Customer Services and their long suffering Premier Team, I am the only dissatisfied client (until you read this website).Fire the bright spark who came up with this and bring back the only one, which was so easy to use.            
                If you want a bank - don't use HSBC - no wonder using switching deals to attract customers as they won't attract them any other way            
                The old website worked reasonably well but the new one is a disaster. Why has it been changed?Almost impossible to navigate. I visited it today in order to cancel a monthly payment on my Visa Gold Card but I had to give up as I could not find out how to do what should be a simple operation. Tried to phone but all lines were busy as usual. In the past I have waited 20 minutes before giving up in despair.Very disappointed.            
                The new online banking site is next to useless. Pages freezing up or very slow. By all means upgrade things but make sure it works first. Nothing wrong with the old site. When I complained they told me it was my browser that was the problem?  What sort of answer is that!  Set it up to work with all browsers then!            
                Where to start... â¢ staff cannot speak good Englishâ¢ extremely rudeâ¢ branches smells like toilets that wasn't cleaned for years!! â¢ they don't appreciate your timeâ¢ one branch that I know only have certain people which is Indians! No whites, no black, no other humans but Indians!â¢ I asked to withdraw Â£600 from my account but instead she gave me Â£60! She said I cannot give you more as I suspect something wrong with your account haha! Unbelievable! Her manager came and gave me the rest of the money! â¢ they do not smile! I think it's a culture thing at HSBCâ¢ inexperienced staff members even though they are old and not friendly! Honestly, I do not know why HSBC is a bank! It should be a rubbish collection service! Ridiculous!!!!            
                If I could show no stars then I would.I have made two formal complaints about the new format for online banking.  I have been told that I should change my browser to Firefox because their software doesn't work properly with Google Chrome or Apple Safari - what a joke, how many millions of people use these?  They also tried to tell me it was more customer friendly!! How can it be customer friendly when you can't view all of your transactions as you could before!  I couldn't even see the payment of my salary the other day.  If it doesn't improve or change, I will be changing to another bank.            
                Asked for account payment limits to be changed.  It took several weeks instead fo 24 hours, 2 calls and a formal complaint.  When the complaint was responded to, it was very obvious that HSBC staff had lied about what they had/had not done.  The complaint handler must have elected to ignore the recorded calls as they would have shown the problem.I cant trust them so I'm off elsewhere.            
                HSBC is funding destruction of SE Asia jungles. Switching elsewhere today!            
                If this farce of a site is not improved I am changing banks.  The new online banking does not work properly            
                Absolute idiots - They've rang me 5 times this week telling me that ive failed to make the repayment to my loan.  The payment was drawn from my account by direct debit on time and I had also made overpayments of over Â£550.00 in that month. I discussed this with the first idiot, and then I get another phone call from them again, to have the same conversation again and again and again.  4 days later there still ringing.  They had told me it had flagged up on there system as unpaid - wrongly!  I asked them if they had actually bothered looking at my account, and they replied, oh let me just load it and have a look.  And then appologise after.  How about learning to update your stupoid sytems then! I shall be transferring this loan elsewhere, not worth the hassle!!            
                i have changed my debit card 7 times with in 4 months with hsbc due to the cards not reading and they cant find the problem and when the money amount is selected to come out if allowed the money doesnt come out and it deducted it from my account this has happen 3 times hsbc is the shittest bank ever            
                With HSBC closing branches left right and centre, their internet offering has become even more important than it already was. So which genius decided to change it to look slick while making the whole thing confusing?The previous site was intuitive and all the information was presented on one screen. The new site is arranged more in panels so requires a lot of scrolling and simple functions like paying a regular payee is now made complicated.  Worst of all, the whole site has a backdrop of a photo of Hong Kong which stays static as you scroll through the myriad of pages to find your information, which is really distracting. There was nothing wrong with the old site, why spend money on this rubbish while closing branches to save money?            
                I have been banking with them for over 8 years and its a great bank            
                My parents opened me a bank account when I was young for savings. When I came of age I decided to join HSBC and take out anow advanced account in 2012 which came with benefits and a Â£12 charge. After opening an account elsewhere I handed in a request to close my account but left my savingson account open. So now it's 2016 and after a phone call with the hsbc accounts opening team was told i would be elegible to open a current accojnt and an appointment was made in branch. I made a choice to rejoin HSBC but to my amazement I was told my previous account was closed in 2015 with "bad debt". Cinfused I asked how this was the case as i hadnt eveb recieved any documentation but the attitude of the staff was disgusting.  Jnstead of offering clarification and support I was told my savings would be closed. Clearly outraged i asked to speak to a manager (let's just say all helll broke loose) after I heard the member of staff call me a t**t as she left the room. After a talk with the manager I left the branch and wrote a complaint to HSBC. Since the letter sent I've received another letter from HSBC confirming my accountson have been shut down at my request.Not only that the staff are unorganised and extremely unprofessional. Would avoid using this branch Willenhall is much better.Absolute jokeGoes to show they closing branches in UK because there a bunch of ducking c*nts            
                Get Your customer service back to the UK! its not acceptable talking to people that only trained to tell you certain things, a simple bank transfer from UK to USA took you 40 days! and never got on my account, and all I was hearing from more than 25 customer support located in somewhere in ASIA(we all know where!) and they were talking even with same words, nothing to be offered no extra look into the matter no promise nothing! disaster I hate HSBC forever!            
                The new online site is far worse than the old simple and comprehensive one .Clunky confusing constantly scrolling.I cannot see all my accounts at the same time.Making payments is confusing having added stages to achieve the easy fluent sequence used previously.They have to separate the phone screen app from the larger desktop application to which it is currently completely unsuited. Looks like I have to move .Sadly as I've been a customer over fifty years.            
                Basically just really dull customer service. Without getting into my boring personal banking...I've experienced really inferior service. All banks have policies but HSBC seem stuck ridgid when dealing with the public. They check the policies before they even look the customer in the eye or smile. (Bishop Auckland High Street branch)It goes along way....good customer service. We all need good banking services and I feel HSBC turns a blind eye at policy and implements customer service when dealing with large sums of money.I've recently read that HSBC is closing branches throughout the country...I sincerely hope they go under all together.I've sinced changed banks and I'm happier. Be careful.            
                I have been a customer of HSBC for around 18 years and for the last year I have been saying my in goings shouldn't exceed my out goings but always do the way they work their accounts is awful today I found out from transactions given to me tha infact my out goings are way less than my in goings but I seem to have les and less money all the time bills going out after already being taken off my available balance and from  the transactions  given to me I have triple checked the workings out and they owe me money and they say no !!! So angry with them I am looking in to this further and seeking professional help also and if I'm right I will be claiming every penny back and compensation for all the inconvieience I've had !!!            
                â86 year old lady, long standing HSBC Bank UK account holder (decades) with dementia, has her life savings lost by the bank & they do nothing to return them, nearly one year on & still missingâ            
                They seem to want me to go beyond my overdraft so that they can charge me. I relied on them declining my payment when I had spent to the limit of my overdraft so I am able to know when to put more money in. I have a busy job and I'm not always able to check my accounts. A completely useless bank.            
                always standard message saying that"experiencing high call volume" as every time i have to wait for 10-30 mins for someone to answer my call which is unacceptable.            
                I applied to open an account online and it took over 3 months to complete, and after finally opening the account and them automatically transferring all my balances they totally cocked up my online banking log in details. After phoning customer services numerous times and them saying they have fixed it on every occasion, i have once again just been totally locked out from online banking while trying to do a transfer online. It's the last straw.            
                Extremely slow process for new account application. Call centre delays significant. I cancelled the application after 1 month, HSBC approved the application but took no actions to setup the new account.            
                Used this bank for years and will continue using it but feel like because of their notorious stability in a turbulent financial world they can oppress their customers and not give a hoot. Their online security is excessive and using the digital secure key is unhelpful as if you get locked out at the other side of the world at an hour outside call centre opening times then you are screwed. I would prefer to have the option on mobile to log onto mobile banking OR digital secure key and not merge the two. HSBC: remember the world banks at their time not yours, in such a competitive market you should step up to this demand (ideally without using an Indian call centre)            
                For years I have banked with HSBC. I accepted their interest rates were never the best, but I always rated them highly for customer service, fraud detection and a good website. I'm sad to say the call centre in India is appalling. If I am going to face the challenge of a language barrier, I am not going to sit in a 10 or 20 minute queue for that. They also bombarded me with personal questions about income, outgoings, employment, place of birth, marital status etc. If the law says I am forced to share this, they need to do this in a sensitive manner supported with an admin campaign. This is where a UK call center should have stepped in. And as for the website, I'm kind of getting on with the new one, but I am appalled at the level of testing. For example, to open a message in chrome, you have to right click and open in new tab. So I can believe why people are frustrated. There was nothing wrong with the old website but I'm afraid this is just IT culture in general. Stakeholders are seduced by fancy graphics, digital platforms and fast delivery of change. They don't care about quality,  robustness or attention to detail. There is a name for this sort of thing in IT. It is called Agile and everyone is going it now. Fast, quick, cheap and chaotic. Banks rely on legacy systems behind the scenes that  need to be carefully managed and don't react well to chaotic web platforms.            
                I thought internet banking on HSBC's old system was a breeze. Not a problem at all. Then you rolled out this travesty.I use a standard sized, relatively new android smart phone which has the latest version of android to pay of my credit cards and make transfers etc.The new system seems to want to be slicker and better but fails miserably. Compared to the old system, the speed at which pages load up is clunky and slow at best. The drop down menus appear all over the place. Up at the top of the screen which is confusing as hell. I've used the new system two or three times over the last couple of months and saw no improvement.I'm pretty savvy with tech. I'd dread to think how your typical Mrs Miggins fairs. Particularly now that you are shutting down even more branches.Please bring back the old system or at least the option to choose. This one stinks. It actually puts me off attempting to pay off my credit cards which is not a good thing is it?            
                Been with HSBC for more than 3 years, account got upgraded to advance a year ago. Still no overdraft, no credit card. Applied twice and both time credit card application rejected. So got vanquis card and a year ago and now I have 5000 GBP credit limit with that card. Never bothered applied to HSBC credit card.            
                Having been a happy HSBC customer of around 30 years (from when it was the Midland Bank), I used to love the simplicity of HSBC online banking, but the 'clever' script-kiddies appear to have taken over and it's now just a convoluted, confusing, and slow mess. Of-course HSBC are going to tell us that's it a great new website, but that certainly doesn't make it so.This is more of a 'last straw' to the Indian call centre handling customer enquiries. No disrespect whatsoever to hard-working Indians however, and kudos to anyone learning another language, but companies tend to overlook the extreme difficulties trying to understand some of them over the phone.My partner and I hate the... "improved" experience so much that we're now inspired to move to another bank, as I suspect it's here to stay. Some just can't leave things alone and have to tinker... for what? It's a BANKING interface - not some fancy shop-front! LEAVE IT ALONE!I would however encourage HSBC customers to vent their opinions through the online messaging route within online banking. At-least with a move we won't need to swallow this for much longer.            
                As with every other time I have visited the business banking section in Yeovil, which is on the first floor I was greeted by an empty reception desk. A couple of people already waiting told me nobody had seen them yet and weren't sure if it was even open. Every visible desk was empty and half expected some tumble weed to roll past.Eventually someone appeared from a back office asking if we had appointments. Seemingly annoyed to have been bothered by customers she reluctantly wandered off to find some staff....The reason for my visit was to make a transfer, which was above my daily limit. HSBC telephone banking told me to visit the branch to make the transfer and take along id etc. Not ideal on a busy work day as it's a way from the office. What they didn't mention was it was cost me Â£30 for something I can do online for free. When I disputed this with the customer services officer I was basically told tough luck. Asked to speak to the manager and she disappeared for a few minutes, presumably discussing it and came back telling me he was too busy but 'might' call me later. Well he didn't call and for the sake of Â£30 have lost my business.            
                I can see I'm not the only one who is stunned by the incomprehensible decision to replace one of the easiest (if not the easiest) to use online banking websites with a complete disaster. The camel's straw for me is the absurdity of entering the sort code for a new payment transaction - after repeatedly entering the code with hyphens it dawned that you don't. Yet sort codes ALWAYS have hyphens, as appears in the confirmation box below.....  Having come across some pretty awful so-called 'upgrades', this site wins the prize for the most ridiculous. Sadly, I think HSBC couldn't give a damn.            
                The most unintuitive banking website I have ever used. It's very easy to miss payments and accuse people of not paying. The help pages are not helpful and don't match the site.Goodbye HSBC            
                I tried to open new savings account a few weeks ago, but I just simply can't. If I walk in personally, they just can't do it because I don't have an appointment, even if I'm the only one (ex. Whiteladies Road - Bristol). I tried to do that online as well, but of course, there is no option to do that = HSBC. I tried to call them as well, but there is all the time something that is stopping me ("we are too busy at the moment, please call us back later", "there is a technical problem, so they can't deal with my query, please call back later" and so on...). Online chat is the same - they can't do that trough the chat (so what is it for?).My personal experience is that they are so rude and they don't care about the customers.It seems time to change - Bye.            
                Five stars for Karen Wild at the Bognor Regis Branch and zero stars for phone service. i had nothing but problems with staff  every time i called, it didnt matter who it was none of them could solve the most simple of problems. if that wasnt bad enough i had to wait a long time each time on the end of the phone waiting to get through.I eventually went into my local branch totally frustrated and i have to say this member of staff is a credit to hsbc , can they not just employ more people like this !            
                Like others I could go on about all the things wrong with the new banking website (can't see as much actual banking information due to over large fonts and squeezed margins, loss of usability by combining debits and credits or ability to search for transactions or ability to download transactions, everything displays in tiny boxes with scroll bars no matter how big your screen as making the page larger just gives more and more background and zero additional content, scrolling the page makes all these boxes randomly scroll - or not - depending on the browser and where your mouse is pointing and a bunch of other factors, messaging to customer services doesn't work at all on Chrome as you can see you have messages but nothing appears when you click so you have to switch to Safari or Firefox, etc.).But the most infuriating thing to me is the indifferent and complacent response from HSBC after very specific and thoughtful feedback on very specific usability issues that first said that they hoped I'd like it more in time, and later that the new design was "fresh". There is no acknowledgement that improvement is needed, instead their response to a customer taking the time to highlight specific issues is that they think it's already better.If I believed that HSBC understood the issues and were working to address them I could live with it a while longer while it's significantly improved, but as their response indicates they think the problem is with me not being able to deal with something being new and different I'm now looking into moving my accounts.            
                Following the advice from another reviewer I contacted the head of IT who passed my complaint about the terrible internet bank program to customer complaints. Somewhat of a cop out I feel.Speaking to customer complaints I was assured that the site was here to stay and they will not admit that there are significant problems.I have been a customer since 1969 but I will now seek a new bank who understands that internet banking should be pleasant  experience.            
                The new layout is appalling! Impossible to see all accounts at a glance and most of the page is taken up with a stupid background picture!            
                I would just like to say 'ere ere!'What an absolute disaster the new online banking site is! I too told HSBC what I thought of it and got the reply 'you will get used to it!'Well I've given it time, but my heart still sinks when it's loading up, and yep, I still hate it! HSBC really do make customers feel worthless, and like so many others on here I'll be moving on to another bank all because of the frustrating rubbish they call internet banking. Sooooo HSBC after 30+ years.......bye!            
                I like using HSBC however no matter when you call them, you always have to wait well in excess of 45 minutes before you finally get through to someone and even then half the time the call cuts out. Even if you want to buy products like insurance from them you still have to wait. costing a fortune. They do however have phones and desks in branch to let you call them free of charge. The old online banking portal used to be great but the new one is terrible. It's difficult to find what you are looking for, it's not mobile friendly at all and on top of that it takes days before a transaction appears on your statement (even non VISA ones). I do like the fact you can view posted letters sent to you online and the email you when theyve sent one as the postal copies usually take weeks especially if you have a direct debit bounce. The postal copy arrives after the second attempt to collect a direct debit happens! The phone banking app is pretty useless for anything other than viewing your balance. It doesn't let you do transfers or direct debits. The staff are usually really professional in branch but can be real jobs worths. I use them to get change for my store but they always insist on filling out complicated change slips that they throw away. When I don't have my work account number to hand they wont let me use my own personal account number to get change! HSBC could be the best bank going if they improved the number of staff in their call centres. Even the branch staff have to wait to get through to the call centre which is ridiculous!            
                been wiith hsbc 30 years - banked online since it was available.  The new design is horrid - not enough info on each page because the writing is huge - can only see a few days transactions at a time - previously could see approx last 20 days. Where are all the functions hidden - yes i found them eventually but what a pain! a backward step.            
                I left HSBC bank because they stole money from my account. I had to start a criminal fraud case to get it back. Also, the customer service is unbelievably shocking. If you like being treated with contempt, choose HSBC!            
                never never use this bank if you don't want to waste your time on fighting with them.            
                I have been with hsbc for last 12 years and it is finally time to switch. First major problem was with my mortgage application where the money was witheld 2 days before contract exchange as they failed to do the valuation survey. The surveyor was appointed by them and they didn' t feel like telling me about it. Their customer service was appaling hence I switched to advance account and it was a great improvement. When called last time I was talking to somene in India again who was reading the scrpit where their favourite word is "sorry" but not awchance to resolve your issue. Had to go to the branch ( the nearest is now 15 miles away as the local one was closed) and the matter was resolved in 3 minutes. Today I found out that I can't transfer more than 10k without paying for it. My T&C failed to mention that.            
                I agree with all of the negative reviews on this site. I am an HSBC Premier customer in Australia and China. One of the big selling points about using HSBC was the intuitive online banking.All the update has done has made the whole experience AWFUL and basic functions unusable - it's one of the most unintuitive user experiences I have EVER known. Here in China I can't even do a basic funds transfer unless I write Chinese (which I don't) - did no one at HSBC do the basic user acceptance testing or consult with a customer? I can't believe any customer would have said anything positive about this dreadful dreadful new design.I like one previous reviewer will likely have to change banks if they don't fix this and revert back.  I need online banking daily but if they can't sort this out I will have no choice.  So what I am saying HSBC,  it would be easier for me to move my mortgages away from you, and move all my banking and direct debits etc than continue to use your awful, horrific new online banking, because it's simply dreadful.Please please do the right thing, apologise to your customers and revert back to the old look and feel without delay.This is a thousand times worse than Apple Mapgate - as we had alternatives. You're basically holding your customers hostage with this terrible UI/UX.  I work in digital and I still cannot believe you have actually launched this site.Sorry HSBC, you are a great bank (not without your faults), but overall a great bank who i have banked with in 4 countries now over the past 12+ years, but this new online banking must go, or I will.            
                I've been using HSBC online banking since it was first introduced, and despite the odd hiccup I've found it pretty good. But like so many other companies (Southern Rail for one), they have redesigned the website and apparently used idiots to do this. The site takes ages to load, each page takes ages to load, there's hardly any information on each page as everything is so big and there are masses of adverts,And as for the statements - almost impossible to spot credits/debits,it's appalling and if it continues in this form I'll be leaving HSBC - having been with them for over 30years.            
                As an IT professional I find the fact that the 'updated' HSBC online banking site was released to the public an absolute disgrace.Functionality that simply doesn't work (try searching for a transaction).Coupled to the fact that my local HSBC branch just got closed, I've now basically got no way to manage my account. There's no way I'm going to use telephone banking.Goodbye HSBC I'd like to say it's been a pleasure - but it hasn't.            
                Pitiful.Random font sizes, random line spacing, TOO BIG, too spread out, have to scroll forever, just so painful on the eye!Sort yourself out HSBC!            
                The old web-site was not good, being in particular covered with advertisements. If I am banking with you, you should respect that and not harass me.The old site at least had two columns, for debits and credits.Now we have only one column with tiny minus signs, and not even red for debit which was used when only typewriters were available to make up the (paper) statement. These were much clearer than any now, because you refuse to use colour!It typically takes more than one click to move somewhere, when it need not.Everything is VERY, VERY SLOW.The web-site team should ALL be sacked immediately and a more competent team assembled. You need to get rid of all the people who thought this was a good idea.            
                I agree with the other negative comments regarding the new "improved" HSBC website. Features have been removed, very slow page loads, not intuitive. Very annoying that HSBC now have a message which says "Good morning, thank you for using Online Banking", however as they have removed the next working day transactions I now have to call HSBC to find out what is due to debit my account! I cannot see how this benefits me or HSBC. To add balance, I personally feel their mobile banking app is excellent, but if they do not change the website I will be moving to another bank.I have emailed their head of digital to complain, suggest other users do the same: raman dot bhatia at hsbc dot com            
                What has happened to HSBCs online banking layout, it is awful?It is now the worse online banking I have ever experienced.  Tried to pay existing payees, but wrought with problems, information is not as ready to view as before, wouldn't accept my six digit security code and is so slow.If HSBC don't update, correct or revert to the old layout I'm going to have to look at banking elsewhere.            
                Compared to the previous site far too little information is displayed, pages take ages to load and half the time are wrong. Making payments crashes out. difficult to navigate. I could go on. Overall pretty much everything is wrong with this site - it is not a premier service at all.            
                Some staff can't read an application form! Also, they take the biscuit when responding to you. This is directed at the Birmingham City Centre Branch.            
                Seriously, this is the only bank in the UK to offer excellent mortgage rate when you are eligible. It is also true the best bank in the UK for internet security and confidence for depositing money.However, when you need to contact them on the phone or being contacted by HSBC, you are quite often have to speak a staff from oversea call center. It is also true that you have to go through a lot of lengthy security checks before getting anything done. At least they have improved the internet banking experience in recent years. It used be a pain when HSBC first introduced the security device.The worst, it usually happens when you visit the branch. The queue is usually long for quite a lot of branches. Some branches do not offer cashier service, you need to check with HSBC before visiting any branch. You may even have to visit the branch for regular ID checks, it really depends on your personal circumstances.            
                The new on line screens are rubbish. You cannot see half the information you could see before, you have to scroll to see what you could see one a single page before, it's prone to errors when making payments, it takes longer to load the information etc. In fact no positives what so ever versus what was available before.            
                What has happened to HSBC? Customers just seem to be a nuisance to them.Do they not read all these dreadful reviews and think that maybe things need to change? When I complained about the ghastly new website I was merely told, in a very patronising way, that I would get used to it and that although they would happily 'take on board' my comments, the new website would be staying. Simple as that!!Really good to know how they value their customers!            
                New website is so laughably bad. Apart from the appalling layout there's some links not working in Chrome Browser.Still waiting for a reply to a query (to another problem with my online banking) sent by secure messaging on 16th December - or a reply to either of the followup secure messages sent since then to ask if they are going to respond.Have tried Live Chat twice to resolve the problem - the answer? Please send a secure message one more time (just in case the first 3 weren't enough to prompt a reply?) even though the 'adviser' acknowledged that the 3 previous messages had been received by HSBC. Then the Live Chat 'adviser' said I should ring the help line for an answer. (even though I had already informed him that I had tried this twice and they had told me to send a secure message!!) I'm not sure I have enough patience to wait in another phone queue to HSBC in case I get lucky and get through to someone who has a vague grasp of both how HSBC works and the English language.I tried sending an email to the customer care team........but they haven't replied.Do you think I should be looking for a new bank?UPDATE - just tried to ring to be told of high call volumes, 25 minutes wait and perhaps I could ring back later!            
                Terrible service. HSBC appoint their own solicitors and these are chosen form a panel. in our case Breezeplus were chosen. It is now 2 weeks past our completion date and for the last month I have been unable to contact anyone from Breezeplus to find out what is happening. Most of the time the phone system is engaged. The times you can get through there is a minimum 40 minute wait on the queueing system before you get through to a call center who will reliably say they themselves cannot get through to a) the solicitor dealing with the case or b) any one of their managers if you try to escalate. Complaining to HSBC doesn't get very far either as they themselves cannot get through to Breezeplus to lodge a complaint. Why HSBC would use such shoddy companies that will ruin their reputation I cannot say. But the whole system is broken and HSBC need to step up and appoint professional solicitors and not two bit, dodgy solicitors who don't have enough resources to do the work or employ a working phone system.Meanwhile my fixed deal has ended with my current mortgage provider and im now paying Â£100 more a month than I would be if this mortgage had completed on time.Thanks HSBC, for nothing..!            
                The new internet banking site is dreadful. It is so confusing to navigate - looks too busy. I absolutely hate it. Have been a customer for over 30 years and if they don't revert to the old site - I will be moving banks.            
                They had a near-perfect online banking system which I would have scored them 5-stars for. They forced me to the new system. Nightmare.            
                IF IT ISN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT!I've been with HSBC for over 30 years with relatively few problems. However the new internet banking system is a disgrace I detest it!HSBC Online banking used to be quick and effective to use.BRING BACK THE LINK TO THE OLD VERSION            
                I've been with HSBC around 20 years with no problems.However the new internet banking system is infuriating, hard to navigate, full of annoying advertisements and feels clunky and disjointed.I loathe it!What used to be done in seconds now takes forever as the toolbars are hidden, what moron designed this?More to the point what moron decided it was a good idea to roll it out?Natwest here I come.            
                I deposited Â£200 in the cash drop machine, only to find out that Â£180 was transferred to my accont. I called them up - the response was I made a mistake which is not true since my mum and I counted the money before we put it in the envelope. The women calling from the surrey quays branch was rude and basically said I can't count. I am definitely going to move to another bank now.            
                Honestly, I have been with HSBC now for 3 years and cannot wait to leave. There were 2 reasons I joined but now that these are no longer an issue I have only got the fixed mortgage term left to run and will definitely be heading else where - may even leave before. There is never anyone available to meet you unless its months in advance and the call wait times are absolutely shocking and have been for at least the last 3 years. The patronising robot who greets you still describes it as "High call volumes" When will they man up and admit that its normal volumes and actually down to their chronically understaffed call centres?            
                Difficult to navigate, over complicated and I don't feel that my accounts are private in the midst of so much advertising. To cap it all I cannot see how I can download my statements into Microsoft Money directly! Complete loss of functionality. Bloody useless time to change banks            
                what a complete shambles.    difficult to see and navigate.   why fix a clock when its ticking  !!            
                I transfer money from my current account to my 2 credit cards at the end of every month, and haven't had a problem till now. The payment to my Tesco credit card did not go through but strangely the payment to my HSBC card did.As there was a 15 minute wait on the helpline, i tried on-line chat. The operator kept telling me things i already knew and the process was so frustrating and long winded, that I gave up; which was probably the object of this system.Unless this useless website improves i shall be moving my account to another bank            
                I've spent most of my life trying to speak to someone at HSBC. The app is ridiculous, the number of passwords you need to do anything is insatiable... and then when you need to reset a passcode they make you wait 60mins on the phone.            
                Online banking is unusable I will be moving to another bank this week If they do the same with business banking I will move that too            
                Wow! How the hell did they come up with this rubbish! It is woeful. Bring back the old system now before people flee in frustration!            
                HSBC's new online banking system is the worst I have ever seen.  I bank with five different banks and HSBC online banking was the best by some way.  Quite an achievement - it's managed to leap-frog all of them to take the prize for the worst after the new system was introduced.  Everything takes so much longer.  I just input payment details for one bill, to be told at the end that it was a recognised payee (oh good - so glad) and then it deleted all my inputs and asked me to pick from a list of circa twenty similarly named payees, after which I had to re-input the reference and amount details.  Why?  Whoever designed that system should be fired along with the management team that ever thought it was a good idea.  Just dire.            
                I have been a customer with HSBC for over 15 years now but this will end very soon. Any of you have any recommendations- please send them.There has been no notification as to when the link to the previous version will be removed - clearly they don't care if they disgruntle their customers.Last year, when I complained about the new website design their rep said I should watch the tutorials!!! (Sure my time not theirs) AND that I will get used to the new website which I find an outrageous statement. I'm the customer here, I lend you my money for a bargain and this is how you see fit to treat me - with disrespect and by being patronising! HSBC Online banking used to be quick and effective- now one can add 50%+ more time to get the same number of transfers sorted.It really surprises me how ignorant some companies still are - well here are some questions for HSBC based on known facts that exist for many, many years now: True or False: 1) customers prefer buying products that are self explanatory 2) customers prefer spending their scarce free time going through tutorials  3) customers prefer spending their scarce free time on topics and interests that matter to them (family, friends, travel, studying, hobbies) 4) customers prefer being treated like adults and with respect            
                Every single thing I try to do with HSBC is a nightmare. The app is a disaster. The branches are useless. Absolutely hopeless!            
                Been with HSBC for +30 years, and always thought highly of them.However.The new online banking site is just so poor........................Confusing, ilogical, slow, what more do I need to say.I rarely complain about anything, in this case I just have to put something in writing. Real sad.................Embarrassing for such a professional company.            
                Having held HSBC bank accounts (including business accounts) for over 40 years, and tolerated reductions in service levels throughout that time, HSBC's recent changes to their website was the final straw. Not only was it difficult to follow but some of the instructions for moving money were, frankly, incomplete and incorrect - I advised them of this and received a bog standard reply. I have now closed my accounts.            
                HSBC you should be ashamed. The new online banking site is extremely unfriendly, very difficult to navigate and frustrating to say the least. Sort it out or you will lose customers.....or perhaps that's what you want? I have another account with Santander and their site is brilliant by comparison. Make the people who did this pay for it by redesigning something we can all use without needing a degree in computing logic.            
                Who ever designed the new online banking wants sacking HSBC is`t a pile of rubbish the old one was bad enough but you seem to have created somthing even worse, i just can`t use it, things are now harder to find and as for printing out statements it prints out about 20 sheets of A4 for the month i could get the whole months on three pages with the old system,At least give us the option of using the old system which has now been taken away!            
                Absolutely HATE the new version of HSBC online banking. It is like a kids play version of a bank account.  Why on earth they decided to consolidate the paid out and paid in into one column is beyond me, and their reason behind this?....to make it easier for partially sighted customers!!  Yes they actually told me this.  I've got great eyesight and I struggle with the little tiny minus symbol next to transactions and trying to find the paid in mingled between them.  Note for HSBC, partially sighted people have worse eyesight than most people, not better!!!  Couldn't an option be implemented for partially sighted people so the site switches to this shambles, rather than make everyone suffer it?We are now in the process of looking for another bank to transfer our mortgage and bank accounts, and I've been a customer of Midland/HSBC for 33 years.  They obviously want to cut down their number of personal account holders to concentrate more on business customers.  I'd prefer if they had just been honest and said this.Poor move HSBC!!            
                I have been a customer of this "bank" for 15 years and a Premier account holder for the last ten. For half of that time the local branch were fantastic and always went the extra mile to make my banking a pleasure.  All that has changed and head office now cracks the whip. Nothing can be done and the whole experience is awful. HSBC is happy to launder drug money or help its executives evade tax.  But they no longer offer a banking service in any real sense.            
                Having banked with HSBC for nearly 40 years, I am very disappointed with the awful new Online banking system which is a complete nightmare.  The old on-line banking system was excellent - concise, easy to use and clear.  The new system is the exact opposite and doing my monthly accounts is now taking twice as long as usual.  Initially there was a facility which enabled you to switch back to the old system, but that has now been removed - I hope HSBC are reading the reviews and will revert to the old system asap, or will at least give users the choice to use the old system if preferred.            
                Who is benefiting from the new system? Anybody? HSBC informs me that they are aware of the problem of not being able to download data to financial packages such as Microsoft Money and say they are working on it. I just can't wait and will be moving to a more competent bank. I have been with HSBC for over 40 years!!!The facility to use the old system has been removed - WHY !!!            
                No longer able to clearly see debits and credits, I want to see them all like I used to. The page is small yet the font is big,space isn't utilised. Move money section is irritating. The whole change is for the worse.   I want to have the old layout back.  Listen to your customers and revert back.  There was a option to use the old layout before but looks like its gone. I might leave if not as I cant stand it .            
                This bank, nightmare. I am an experienced online banker. Every time I've been into hsbc to do just a little transaction, something natwest will do very effortlessly, hsbc will make you regret ever thinking of banking with them. They are so useless. Nothing ever works. You can't get anything done when you need it.            
                As a loyal customer of HSBC for the last 6 years, I wish to ask those who are responsible for this switch to at least let customers choose if they want to have this new layout or rather stay with the old one. Personally, I feel more comfortable withe old version, it was easy, smooth and user friendly. The new one is not good.            
                Having spoken to many advisers re a product finally decided they are not worth my time or my money wont go near them ever again there going downhill!            
                I had no problem with the old version and I much preferred the layout.  This new version is sonslow and keeps hanging up, spent 45 minutes ast night trying to make 3 payments, gave up after 2.            
                As with Vinrouge's review below HSBC's new online banking does not meet my needs and I will be considering moving accounts after more than 20 years with Midland/HSBC.The previous site gave you lots of account information on screen and easy access to facilities such as making payments. The new site has been designed for mobile and all information is now displayed in a single column, wasting screen width.A big problem for me is the transaction display. The old site would show a full page, approx 2 to 3 weeks of transactions. If you wanted to look back further you could search by date range. This search was already pre-populated with the prior months date so to jump back you clicked a single button. Transactions were also displayed with credits and debits in separate columns, making it easy to scan for payments.The new site does away with all that. The account screen shows me the last  3 transactions on my account. If I want to see more I click and the list expands into a single column list which scrolls back in time. The debit and credit columns are now merged into one, with only a tiny minus sign indicating a debit. There are no delimiters between months. There is no facility to search by date range.These changes make it more difficult to find payments.Lots of other issues add up to a very unsatisfactory experience using the site - slow performance, unintuitive layout, floating content over an image of the HK skyline which is more akin to using a media site. According to someone on twitter they were part of the focus group for the redesign and the new site does not reflect what they agreed to - strange! I've sent plenty of feedback and although my emails have been acknowledged I've yet to get a response to some of the questions I posed, so I'm not too happy with their customer service either.I am in the process of moving my savings account (YBS - great online banking) as that's an easy one. Pending the outcome of my feedback I will also move my main account elsewhere,  something I never imagined i would do. At the end of the day, people will adjust to the site, new customers won't know the difference, and it will all die down in a month or so. But I hope HSBC learn a lesson or two from this.One more thing - if you are thinking of moving to HSBC, go in to one of their banks and ask for a demo of the online banking - the promotional videos do not represent what you actually get and make it look a lot better than it is.Update:29/12/16Still waiting for responses to my feedback and queries. I can see why HSBC customer service is consistently rated poorly.Update:09/01/17Except for another 'sorry you had to contact us' email, still had no response to my feedback and queries, so I'm moving to Nationwide. Their online banking looks really impressive, their help staff have responded to all my communications within a day and with the current account switch guarantee it will all be done in 7 days. Bye bye HSBC!            
                My experience is similar to other reviews below. The previous version of HSBC online banking worked extremely well. The new one simply does not meet my needs. I have tried politely to explain this, but it seems that HSBC is not listening.I am now in the process of transferring my account to a bank that does provide the service I want.  This is a reluctant but necessary move, after having been nearly 60 years with Midland/HSBC.Update: Accounts moved. Surprisingly easy to do. Choose preferred start date with new banking provider, and allow 7 days for switching to take place.            
                The new website is a nightmare!!!!!it doesnt work for me.I cannot believe they are doing this to us. After 10 years of being a loyal client I have to close my accounts with them because of that stupid new online banking. After 10 attempts to try to log in, took me 1hour to make a transfer .Who has the time for this nowadays? tried to call, was hang up after waiting 15mins. Horrible horrible experience. New online banking is worst nightmare ever imagined . I cannot even access my messages!!!!            
                HSBC Online Banking - the most complicated pile of horse manure security ducking...shhhh!te... ever to be imposed to its costumers, EVER. Its isn't a security measure at all. Its upgraded fancy arsed HORSE MANURE!!! They impose charges and interest out of nowhere within the first 3 months of its use back in 2014. Originally, to protect my primary bank accounts else where (certainly NOT HSBC, that's for sure), I set up HSBC exclusively to mitigate any issues that will arise. I'm being deliberately vague here, duck you. These charges were small, penny pinching, however, I don't like being robbed of my monies. I wanted to close my account in the summer, because I was paying for charges - charges of UN-arranged overdrafts, because someone stole monies out of my account in the year 2015. I simply didn't want to have to deal with them any more. What's even worse about it is it isn't simple to close your account. I thought I could just do it over the phone. NO!! To close your account, you can't just phone and request to have it closed. You have to pop into your nearest branch (I think?) and request for its closure. Welp, my nearest branch is MILES AWAY and I DON'T DRIVE WHICH IS STUPID SINCE I LIVE IN THE FLIPPING COUNTRYSIIIIIIDE are you mad.The other option is to download a PDF file and send that off through email (?) or through the post. I remembered in thinking the dodo on the phone weren't very clear on the details of the address to send the printed off request to. Twice I told her to read out the address to me and twice she repeated it. How sweet of her. She sounded hard faced and overweight. I like my woman with a bit of weight on. Sigh* A Google search of the address yielded nothing anyway. Google offered what was the correct what was the correct address, but under a different department, but didn't want to risk it. Imagine me sending off details of a request to some random address in Coventry? Dear lord I honestly don't know what made me double checked the address. Honestly....So I signed the form by editing the PDF file and lazily sent it to some HSBC email domain in hopes they'll respond to my request. I know right? Seriously, I just didn't want to have to deal with them any more then I have to. 2 months later, I get another letter informing me they'll close my account and yet AGAIN, they imposed yet more STUPID penny pinching charges which I had to pay off. They are utterly useless. USELESS LUMPS OF GOBSHITE GOOD FOR NOTHINGS, can't even take a request by phone. MORONS!!!! You can keep your upgraded cat p!zs complicated horse manure sign in with a key code in order to move the REST OF MY MONEY OUT, generated bull crap, codswallop. You can keep your conniving penny pinching service. Duck you and goodbye. Today is the last day I'll log into my account. I'll leave enough pennies in till the day they inform me they'll close my account due to inactivity. When that day comes, I'll rejoice in ridding the stone that is HSBC from my bladder for good. Duck off s*hhhhitting HSBC!!!!            
                I had a very old cash ISA account with HSBC with a  small balance  so  as it wasn't earning any interest, I wrote to HSBC enclosing the latest statement and asked them to close it and send the balance to my (non-HSBC) account or forward a cheque for the closing balance.  No response, so wrote to the Complaints team.  Subsequently received a letter  "enclosing a cheque".  However, as  there was no enclosure   I wrote again  to the complaints team.  Curt reply, no apology for their incompetence and their attitude is very defensive.  Just told me they'd "send another".  and that was the last I heard from them.  Why employ a Complaints team if they're so ineffective? Our joint account was with HSBC but we closed it down and went elsewhere because the service was so poor. The reviews on here say it all about this bank! The customer is obviously just an inconvenience to them.            
                It seems like many who are loyal customers to HSBC that their new website is having a negative impact.  I too who have both business and personal banking with them and have had so for over 40 years, now find online banking a less than positive experience.  As others have said previously the site was a good one, easy to navigate, few clicks and you could print off on one page.  Now:  printing out takes anything up to 4 pages as the line spacing is far too great; there is the assumption that I want to look at my current account (which I rarely want to do as the first view); you cannot see your overall accounts on one page you have to scroll down the little bit allocated on the left (??!!). The accounts dropdown box is not good enough.  This site now takes more time, more paper and the background of the city image, well how does anyone with eyesight problems and above all dyslexia manage.  Like others who sanctioned this site to be released, who developed it and why on earth haven't customers been given some sort of option about it.  I too use other sites and this one now is the worst out of them all.  HSBC be like Marks and Spencer and take the hit and change it, would be better for your branding and above all your customers.... whom it seems are moving elsewhere.......            
                The new HSBC online banking website is a disgrace. It is unusable. It is simply designed for smartphones. After 40 years with Midland/HSBC I will have to change banks unless they restore the previous system as an option - they seem to have disabled that option already            
                I tried switching to HSBC business banking not realising how bad their customer service is. Luckily they needed additional info and needed to call me, I had a missed call from them so I called back, the woman was very abrupt, tried transferring me and said there was no one to take my call. Not an initial great advert for a prospective new bank account, I've never rung my current bank and been told I can't wait to speak with someone. They tried to ring again (unsociable hours), I missed their call again so they sent a no-reply email saying they are unable to offer banking facilities. I didn't ask for any borrowing of any kind and my business doesn't have borrowing so I have no idea why but they've certainly done me a favour after having seen these reviews!            
                I am honestly thinking of leaving after 20+ years because I can't be bothered with their crap website. The old website was much better so whoever it was within HSBC that approved the release is a clown. Grade A clown.            
                I also have been with the HSBC for 30 years, Like others I think they have taken a MASSIVE backwards step with the new online banking website. The text is pixelated, the layout is appalling and its a lot slower than it was. I was amongst the first to take up internet banking back in probably the early 90's and have other savings and investment accounts with the like of Halifax, Nationwide and Santander. HSBC was the easiest to use, the best layout, the best security - now its by FAR the worst.            
                The "new" HSBC banking is like a beta built by a 5 year old whilst his father was erecting stonehenge. How did this pass QC?As platforms advance HSBC have gone backwards. Whereas it used to be set out like a bank statement in full screen you now have a receipt type little box (with minimal information) overlay of a city silhouette. Take trying to make a payment to a child, friend or relative etc (or any other business you have previously dealt with) was simple to carry out by pressing " make a payment " you now have to create a payee. Ok! Not so bad eh ? Until you try to find the account information in that little receipt style statement/activity I mentioned earlier. There is no account number or sort code. Using the touch screen does not bring any details either. Personally I have gone back to telephone banking but if this is not sorted in the next 6 months I will change banks after 35 years of being with HSBC and Midlands bank.I am not a moaning Minnie that loves to give out negative reviews and I know how important a review and feedback statement is. But it's important to be honest regardless is it is positive or negative.Darren. Wrexham            
                The new personal HSBC web site layout when used on a PC is dreadful. It's supposed to be easier to use and it has obviously been designed be geeks with no grasp on the reality of user friendliness. I notice the Business pages have not been changes and forced on these customers - I wonder why? I wish I had the time to find a new bank.            
                The new internet banking website has obviously been designed for smartphone users with a very limited screen width. Apparently HSBC are incapable of designing a responsive website, so if you want to review your accounts on a computer, the only transactions list available is so narrow that credits and debits are listed in the same column! One transaction can take up to 4 lines, so if you have more than an handful of transactions a month you end up scrolling down miles of display. I consider all this to be unusable.When I complained, I was told that I'd get used to it! Further complaints resulted in comments from HSBC about people who were resistant to ANY change, and a categorical statement that credits and debits would remain in one column. The letter I received from HSBC gave information on complaining to the Financial Ombudsman, but a fellow complainer on the HSBC Facebook page said that she'd tried this, and the Financial Ombudsman said they couldn't deal with complaints about websites. So at least I knew not to waste my time.I worked as a technical author for 20 years, and was involved with user interface design. I am stunned that HSBC consider their non-responsive website to be an acceptable solution for their customers. Did they not test it on a range of equipment and a wide range of users? There are various aspects that are inconvenient and non-intuitive, but I could (reluctantly) live with those. However, the transactions list is downright unusable. I really don't want to go through all the aggro of moving our accounts elsewhere, but it seems that I have little choice, given HSBC's inability to recognise that they have made a mistake. A clear transactions list seems to me to be a pretty fundamental thing for a bank to provide, and they have failed.I could also list all the other niggles I've had, but there are other times when HSBC has been quite helpful, and I also like the security of the secure key - unlike many other users, apparently. So I've been prepared to live with those, having banked with Midland since before it became HSBC. Sadly, it now seems time to wave goodbye.            
                Only been a member for 2 months. Biggest mistake I've ever made. Paid a cheque in from a ppi claim from a previous bank, the fraud squad intervened and blocked my account without warning. A dozen phone calls later and over a week without being able to withdraw money and still no one seems interested in helping. If people are looking to bank with HSBC do yourselves a big favour and look elsewhere.            
                HSBC have served my banking needs for both business and personal for the past 24 years. Unfortunately the new online banking resembles a toy / phone app. When it comes to online banking, it needs to be clear and professional, the previous classic site worked well, easy to navigate and I always had great confidence in understanding my accounts. HSBC has now removed the link to use classic system - I'm now going to review alternative banks and move away from HSBC.            
                Have tried to open a new 'community account' with HSBC recently and it has been one of the worst of the companies i have to deal with to attempt to open this account.I appreciate you ahve to supply certain information, but when you do they dont accept it.  Wont accept my bank account statement as i bank with First Direct which is part of HSBC?Have lost track of the hours i have wasted on the phone trying to get through on the phone to them,no-one ever answers the phone.Went into the local branch and the employee did not have a clue what i needed to supply, she was actually reading of the leaflets they supply in store, then to top it off, she was reading what was required for personal account until i reminded her, mine was not a personal account but rather a community account, so she had to log on to her system and search for information there.So frustrated as i wasted so much time on this matter in the end i cancelled the application and went to another bank instead.Learn from this, do not go near HSBC as they are a joke!            
                I ask for a paper with a stamp ...very rude womens work in that office and also they don't want to help at all .I don't understand how the people get hirred in this position. THEY GET PAYD TO HELP YOU NOT TO SPEAK AND TREAT YOU LIKE THE LAST PERSON !!!SHAME  HSBC !!! I will change the bank for sure from january            
                HSBC over the phone are rude and have the worst customer service. I got this guy calling me from HSBC. he started by throwing many questions on me and then told me that i had to call them. i said why ? if i give you everything correct. he was like i cant confirm why it is blocked ? i asked why are you calling me? he said i cannot confirm why we are calling you. i just hope that one day these jobs outsourced to India can get back to Britain as communication with customer service will be better. very frustrating when you have someone who does not understand and get your account blocked for nothing. I have never faced any problem walking into the bank and discuss my issues or have loans from there. but i have always faced issues on the phone with those guys abroad. then he HUNG UP THE PHONE            
                Rarely have I been so wound up about a bank,  which normally is just there in the background but now it is as if HSBC wants to push is customers away.  I write to them to complain and they respond 'we feel' but what about how I feel !!I'm so angry about this I'm just going to move elsewhere. They've lost it !            
                There are many banks out there that would look after you and your money. But I'm not even a customer and yet, they're so rude, no wonder why people are complaining. If you want better service, then you'll have to look else where            
                Online banking website worst I ever used. They not care about Customers at all.            
                I first decided to switch my current account to HSBC using their switching service which has, according to them 'never been easier'. I've switched banks before, largely promoted by switching bonuses rather than any significant issue with my prevoius bank, and expected the same seven day service. Here's how it went. On the first day, October 30th,  I applied online via their switching link. I expected, as other banks do, to complete this entire process right away. Instead I got the whole way through the process without being asked for my current bank details. The application ended and said precisely nothing about how I'd switch. I was left scratching my head and thinking I'd somehow ballsed the process. Forty minutes on the phone the following day finally got my answer. Apparently HSBC require you to open a new account and then switch to them when his account opens fully. I then waited nearly six weeks for anything in writing, all the time being told by customer services that they had no record of my application. Apparently a surge in applications had led to a backlog requiring a separate company to assist with the application process. When finally receiving paperwork with an account number I called up again. This time they could find me but I still couldn't switch as it wasn't fully open. A week later and a debit card arrived through the post. This has misspelt my surname on the card but correctly on the letter.  A further call to get a replacement card. Eventually I call up today and ask if I can switch. They ask me my account number and I give it as per the letter and card. I'm then told the account numbers are eight numbers long but mine is six, another mistake. When they finally find me they tell me my 'telephone security has failed', meaning I hadn't returned a security details form which I have never received. Another week long delay. I've now asked to cancel the application altogether. This is a joke of company. The 'world's local bank' probably get their nickname from everyone having a fumbling moron of a neighbour they closely resemble. A switch process should be easy, not painstakingly frustrating. Why can't they do as every other major bank seems to do and get things settled in a week. At my last count these are already eight times slower and counting.            
                HSBC had a good, easy to use screen for online users. But, then, they decided to change it because - they say - they listened to their customers and made online banking a better experience. What we have now is an absolutely dreadful, confusing, totally unclear and appallingly difficult system to navigate! Previously, you could scroll your account and easily identify debits and credits because they were in separate columns - a standard accounting approach. Now, they are both in one column and you have to watch out for the little minus symbol. Also,why do we need a confusing pile of boxes, with a background of, presumably, Hong Kong! If you go to messages and open one, how do you get back to your account details? Perhaps it's me, but before it was simple, now you are in danger of unwittingly logging out. The whole thing is just rubbish, presumably a need to justify the high salary of some IT web designer! It's not user friendly, it's not what the customer wants, it's just somebody trying to be clever and failing miserably. HSBC - PLEASE listen to your customers and give us back our old, beloved website - or, at least, the option to choose.            
                Having been with this bank since receiving my first payslip over 35yrs plus... HSBC have finally pushed me to throw away my loyalty and move.All I want to do is view my accounts in the 'classic' view, having struggled  with the new upgrade (?) , over the last weeks, this had been available until this weekend. Having found the new screen layout difficult to navigate, gain information, limitation of available transactions and use, called the 'help centre' in Far Far Far Far Away Land, to be told by 'Alex' (common name in Asia), they will email a video to help those customers unwilling to accept change. Hmmm...To prove that i can adapt to change, just in the process of closing all of the various Current, Joint, Savings, Credit Card, Euro and Isa accounts that we have...After all Change is good - Thanks HSBC, been too loyal for too long.            
                Please note: this is not a review of the staff, individually they were very pleasant even though a lot of my appointments were a total waste of time, thanks to a failing in the correct training. I was made to feel like a criminal by this bank and continually asked for more information, they know more about my identity than any other organisation, thanks to their "Policies" about money laundering, the irony of it all, was that they were the bank that was caught for money laundering. This bank is a Number one bully using policies to intimidate there customers. I am now in the process of changing banks, I felt the whole experience was traumatic, I don't write reviews but in this case,I am using it as "Therapy" to try and move on. I personally feel mentally raped by HSBC. This review comes from the heart and I am quite open to continuing this conversation with any one concerned with this experience.            
                Went to open an account for a disabled friend yesterday  who was with me, I was told they were too busy and to make an appointment for two weeks in the future Also told "go and do it online or phone" but the person didnt tell me there were phones and internet terminals which I could have used inside the branch while I was there. most worrying was the coldness, he didnt seem to feel my sadness at this. So, We crossed the road went to Bank of Scotland received fantastic service and am now happy.

                I have left my bank card in a busy place where somebody could easily use my card to pay for things via contactless payments. I have called the emergency line straight away at god knows what rate. It has now been 35 minutes that I've been waiting in a que. This is simply unacceptable! I will be transferring my entire balance and closing my account this weekend.            
                I've already complained to HSBC about their stupid new website and - to save them embarrassment - asked them just to keep the button to get back to the old version. They have refused despite many users complaining. I've yet to find a single person who has praised the new site!Two new incidents;1) I was expecting a refund from a retailer on my credit card but new website showed it as a debit (ie it did not have a "CR" or a plus sign) This made me go back to the retailer back & forth several times with me producing a copy of the bank entry. After two weeks of this with the retailer - threatening them with all sort of action - I spoke to HSBC's Premier line and they confirmed that what was shown was in fact a CREDIT into my account! I was absolutely furious with HSBC demanding a written apology to me and the retailer for putting us both through all the hassle and frustrations. HSBC read over the phone the  letter of apology to me but guess what - they didn't send it to me despite assurance I would receive it straight away. All I got after 2 weeks was a letter telling me my complaint is important and has been sent to the right Dept which had another 2 pages of absolute nonsense about complaints procedures that no one has the time to read!2) I was logged on to the new site and arranging a SO, and noticed I had a new message notification - good I thought, this may be the letter of apology - but could I bloody well open it? No, despite spending half an hr trying all options I gave up and sent another complaint.I've been with HSBC since it took over the Midland Bank and am a Premier customer who is now seriously thinking about abandoning ship. It seems the morons who designed the new website didn't have an ounce of creativity or practicality between them. For instance they've got rid of having two columns to show "cash in" and "cash out" which makes life difficult to spot the difference BUT why has no one thought to give a different colour to say "cash in"? a simple thing like this would allow users to scroll down with ease to see - at a glance - the cash in and cash out! easy? simple? -  YES, except for the idiots that are employed by HSBC and the Managers who are dipping their head in sand hoping for the problem to go away instead of earning their fat salaries and DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!            
                I opened an HSBC account online. They confirmed the account had been opened but after another 3 weeks I still hadn't heard anything.I went into the nearest branch, spent between 30-60 minutes there, and the guy apparently sorted everything out. However he now wasn't sure if they would still give me the Â£150 switching bonus which was being offered when I opened the account (and was part of the reason I opened the account to begin with). He said he would speak to the manager and get back to me - which didn't happen.Another 3 weeks later, and I have suddenly received 2 of everything: 2 cards, 2 pin codes etc. Obviously the first application has finally come through after 6 weeks. So I went back into the branch, another 30-60 minutes. The guy that helped me before is now away on holiday, and his colleagues are saying they cannot honour the Â£150 switching bonus.I've just decided to close both accounts (lets hope they can get that right) - really not worth the trouble - trying to deal with a bank who can't even open your account without hassle.I would not recommend HSBC at all.            
                HSBC appear to have fallen apart.Try phoning - today it was over 30 minutes wait, they always have the recording about high volume of calls - a simple thing to remedy if you value your clients, just hire more telephone assistants!The website! HA! is it really intended to show how efficient they are? Why is it so slow, the old site did not leave you waiting."Move money" - have we really dumbed down that far, on my first venture into this maze I was looking for a way to pay a bill, I never would have thought I would "move money" to the firm!.I did not read the instructions (who reads instructions on a website, they are meant to be intuitive) and spent ages fuming as I could not find a way to get back to my accounts, I never thought of clicking on the HSBC logo.A word of warning. The site clearly states the balances are accurate at the time given, unless otherwise stated.  I phoned when I could not understand why the figures were incorrect and was told the balances are not updated at the time given, they were the balances at start of day.Second word of warning - direct debits, I have some that go out on a Monday, they took them off the available balance on the preceeding Friday!The website does not have such useful information as todays currency exchange rates, which would be useful to know before entering all the details for a transfer to a foreign bank.What is that side pull out thing offering help and information - or that image of a person who is meant to answer questions, you enter one and it gives a list of other questions it can answer ignoring the one you have asked.On the whole they have lost their way.            
                I transferred Â£1666.90 in Euros to a guy's bank in Armenia.  I miss spelt his name so his bank refused to credit his account.  I asked HSBC to recall the money on 26/10/16.  They agreed.On 1/12/16 I 'phoned HSBC and asked how the transfer of the money back to me was progressing.  "We've had your money since 15/11/16" the lady said and she also said that she was sorry for the delay in paying it in to my account but that it would be credited to my account within 48 hours.On 3/11/16 when the funds hadn't arrived I filled in a complaint form and this morning,  I had a reply advising me that my concerns had been passed on to the department which deals with such matters and that their response generally arrives after 8 WEEKS.So if the Customer Care Team (was there ever such a misnomer) happen to pick up on this,  could they explain to me the penalties which would be levied against me should I be 8 WEEKS late in making payments?  Will HSBC compensate me for their wholly inefficient handling of my finances and reimburse me at the same rate as the levies which they apply?  I'm all ears!Edit:06/12/16 18:50.  Following on from my justified whinge,  a lady from the Customer Care Team 'phoned me on my mobile,  offered to reinstate the money which was adrift,  and my expenses which were minimal,  I've arrived home,  checked my account and find that she was as good as her word.Currently,  HSBC are in my good-books,  and not just because I now have my money returned,  but because they acted with the minimum of delay.  Thanks HSBC.            
                HSBC has gone from a good, simple user friendly setup, to the most incoherent pile of horse poo ever.I've been with this bank for over 30 years and never have I experienced anything as bad as this.If your looking for a challenge, this is the place for you.            
                The presentation of online banking for HSBC has recently changed from what was a nice clear user friendly layout to a mixed up un-intuitive maze of clap trap. At least HSBC had the decency to leave a back button allowing users to go back to the old format but this has now been removed to force users to navigate their new maze of rubbish!Why do companies do this why not leave the back button for people who don't want the new version, why aren't they customer friendly?            
                I simply want to see Credits and Debits in separate columns (OBVIOUSLY).Very irritating.            
                New online banking system is rubbish, lack of detailed information and very limited use and hard to navigate. HSBC have promised a new updated system, how can you go backwards to even worse then what you started with. Adapted for more mobile friendly by the looks of it but on the computer it is rubbish, HSBC just look at Barclaycard system, years ahead in comparison. Lack of customer focus, no user information, hard to navigate, transferring money is hard and finally when you pay money to your credit card why does it still take 3 days to a show on your HSBC credit card although paying others is instant. Upset and let down is not the words.            
                Applied online for joint account, intending to use switch service - a bonus was applicable if you switched within 30 days. Applied at the end of October - bank cards arrived *one full calendar month* later. Attempted to contact bank helpline to see if we still qualified for switch bonus - could not get a response. Had to go into branch, where there was total confusion. Had to go in AGAIN - to the one branch that opened at the weekend - and sit through the whole 'Ooo sir/madam, don't know whether you'll qualify for the switch bonus'  b*ll**ks all over again. Based on this performance, closed the account immediately.Branch staff were apologetic and tried to be helpful but it wasn't their fault - it really shouldn't have taken a month to open a current account (and I wasn't going to beg for the bonus).Disappointed - and would discourage others from using HSBC. Have had no such problems with *any* other bank. Would recommend Tesco, Barclays, Lloyd's and Halifax over this outfit. Try one of them.            
                No energy to go into all details now.Basically arranged online transfer of funds from current HSBC account to current INGDirect French bank account (I live in France).Nothing happened so after more than 24 hours tried to ring Custmer Service - after 50mins on hold spoke to someone who found possibly held up for fraud enquiry. Gave me another number to ring next day; Credited Â£15 for long wait.Rang next day when told transfer had been cancelled without my being informed. I asked why and was told another bank being used in between HSBC (why, is France so very far from UK?) and my INGDirect account decided my French bank suspicious! I've transferred money this way successfully in past.Now I now I've arranged again with Currencies Direct - very efficient & they have  informed me at each step.Will never use HSBC to try to do this again. Nowhere to complain either.            
                Opening a student bank account was supposed to be done through an online process - but nothing happened so i had to go into a branch to open it and apparently they never even received my application. I finally open a Student bank account, i get sent my Debit card but no PIN so i can't even use it. I request a new PIN in branch, 3 TIMES, and it still hasn't been sent to me! Now, they've sent me a new Debit card for no reason? And so now i have 2 Debit cards with no PIN. Customer service man in branch was rude and condescending, looked down on me because I was a student probably.            
                Tried to open a bank account with them, not feasible as they will not accept any reasonable proof of address. Guess I dodged a bullet here. Happy to take my money somewhere else! In particular, the High Holborn branch should be avoided at all costs.            
                I've been with H.S.B. C. since 1983. When I first joined, I could speak to someone who spoke English; they didn't play the piano to me when I was on hold, ( it's happening now , as I type this); they didn't repeat my questions back to me, as a form of verbal-insurance policy; and, I didn't have to listen, (horrors ! ), to ghastly, excrutiating pop music, when I went into the Orpington, Kent, Branch, to be called a "Guy", by someone standing by three , open-plan desks, where everyone can hear everyone's private business, including Account Numbers, addressees, etc. I've just had my call answered by the bank: I had to ask them the same question three-or-four times before I was correctly understood; a foreigner answered; I had to listen to piano music; and, it was to ask them not to keep sending me advertising,  which I've been receiving, lately, which I've already asked them not to do, as the request hadn't been noted in the record.            
                I would never recommend this bank to anyone. They are the most useless unhelpful rude people in every HSBC branch I've been too. First the Internet Banking App is stupid. and they need to sort there stupid out. I can never login. There reasoning being that my passwords are wrong (when they aren't at all) When transferring money to someone, you have to take the bank details into the branch so that some rude, lazy, unhappy and unhelpful person and register the details onto your card. Then you have to transfer the funds using a laptop first...when then after that they will appear on your mobile app. My chip was also damaged and I had gone into the branch in Stratford. Waited 30 minutes to be seen only to be told 'Its damaged. We'll order you a new card'. Well thanks a lot for NOTHING. I waited 8 working days and I had to call them. There was NO notes to say that I had requested a new one. They never ordered me a new card so I had to wait another 6 working days for it again. You are the worst bank ever and I actually can not think of 1 positive thing to say about you. Horrible service. Horrible set up. Horrible everything.            
                Atrocious cramped, hard to use, useless online banking page. Why they had to change something that worked really well previously, I do not know. Obviously someone at HSBC had to justify their job title.  The whole site feels like it was done for the benefit of HSBC rather than customers. I cannot believe that this useless and illogical change was road tested on real people.UPDATE: There really is a special kind of arrogance at HSBC. Not only do they role out this abomination of a so-called online banking system without consulting customers, but complaints/requests to allow CUSTOMERS to revert to the old website are met with indifference, arrogance and patronisation. The party line seems to be to treat customers as though they are illiterate idiots who are too stupid to use this new system,  and just need steering through the "exciting changes". I work in the business world, and not one firm would use this atrocious layout to manage its accounts, so why should we, the hard-pressed members of the public, have to!?!?            
                0 skills customer service the only thing they are professional with is wasting your time on the phone and in the branch            
                I've banked with HSBC for twenty years but their mission to take everything digital has been of the expense of service. The present combination of the new online banking website plus app security key generation is so unbelievably frustrating. I have never, ever been able to log in on the first attempt. This morning, after half an hour of trying I've given up. At this rate I'll end up moving to another bank. Please sort it out HSBC.            
                Should they be sending threatning messages saying some of my bill payments MAY NOT be payd!! well you need to send me messages saying either you are or your not...not MAY NOTDISCUSTING VILE SO CALLED HUMAN BEINGS they think they are so proper!! WELL THEY ARE NOT...THEY ARE SAD WASTE OF LIVES FULL OF EGO all the staff espetially the ones on the phone!!! SHOCKING!!!            
                The new layout to your on-line personal banking is basically unusable.  Terrible layout, little to no information shown, no way to make a payment to my credit card which worked just fine on the old site, navigation is none existent, incoherent arrangement and I have to click on your logo to get back to a list of my accounts!  I'm not sure you could have done a poorer job had you set out purposefully to create the worst possible on-line banking experience available on the planet today.  Scrap the lot and start again.  Please don't swap your business banking to this terrible format or I'll have to move banks.  Utterly, utterly terrible.            
                the security to get into your bank is absolutely appauling! you have to have 3 password, 5 security questions, a memorable name, a security code and then you need to download the app to generate a random code ontop - this happens EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO LOG IN!!!!!!!! i've been locked out several times for forgetting one of these million codes and each time you have to wait in a que on the phone for 1 hour, to be connected with an idian who you cant even understand and is useless at his job!!! the next time i manage to actually get into my bank to withdraw money, i am closing it as soon as! worst bank i've ever been with! do not go with them!            
                Phoned to discuss a credit limit increase as per a letter from them related to a credit card offer. The person who handled the call was rude and unhelpful. I sent a feedback of my experience to the HSBC and the team leader of the relevant section phoned me to inform that it's their normal standards  of customer care. Awful.            
                I hope HSBC didn't pay anybody a lot of money to come up with this very poor experience!  The initial backward step is a failure to separate out debits and credits in to two columns for ease of reference.  If the customer experience is to be as easy as possible why fail to clearly differentiate the two.  I've read other reviews here today, they're not overflowing with praise are they?  I've not tried to print out the inadequate statement yet nor have I tried to pay anybody either.  But it seems I shall be equally frustrated by those exercises.  I am staying with the old experience as long as HSBC will allow.  Change is good if it's good change and here, for me, HSBC have failed badly.            
                There is so much wrong with the new HSBC Online Banking design.The main transaction window opens up with the first account in the âMy accountsâ list.  This should be customizable to allow for a chosen default account.  I have to change it every time.The lower left hand box is extremely annoying with changing images â I have to pause this before I can do anything else.  This box needs to go and the âMy accountsâ box above it which is too small, needs to be made bigger, which will fill the space.The background image is unnecessary and very off-putting. There is too much wasted space around the boxes.The only plus is the âQuick Transfer boxâ otherwise itâs a huge step backwards Iâm afraid and I agree with other users who feel that it is so bad that they want to change banks.            
                I still hate the new web pages. I have told HSBC numerous times and pointed out the reviews here. Even the text is light grey and fuzzy, and not clear to read. They totally ignore what the customers feed back. They keep telling me the web site is 'enhanced'. They are idiots. If it wasn't for the hassle, I would change banks.            
                This bank is a joke. I suggest everyone to avoid this piece of crap. If you made your choice and got your bank account with HSBC, be ready to the following things: - Your card will be blocked if you do ANYTHING suspicious. Biggest problem with it, it can be anything, I mean, literally anything. Too much money on your account? Blocked. Trying to get some money and the sender is "suspicious"? Blocked. Do they have a bad day? BLOCKED. Overdraft? Blocked.- Speaking about overdrafts... if you have even 1O pence overdraft, you will get a letter from HSBC to call them, or they will find you and drag you to the court. Let me repeat it: for TEN f_cking pence.- But if you want to call them and want to do it free, you have to wait the ridiculously long queue. It's about 4O minutes at least, so if you are on Pay-As-You-Go, you are f_cked. And nobody knows what's happened if your card is blocked. One of my friends went home and spent a little bit too much, he was about 2O pence overdraft. He got a nice Â£3OO fee because of it. And a fee because he couldn't go to the bank and solve it with the reaaally "helpful" customer service, so got over a Â£4OO fee when he run back to England to figure it out what happened. This bank is a disaster. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, except if you are a masochist and you want to suffer. Biggest joke they advertise themselves as the Best Bank of England. Over-compensating, guys? :3You left the biggest number of unsatisfied customers just right after the Co-operation Bank. You are all a joke. (Poor employees at the HSBC... get all the sh_t because leadership is incompetent and can't train their people. )            
                Perhaps with this such a crap service explains why this bank had closed so many branches in the last months.            
                I am writing this on Trustpilot hoping that HSBC will might see this.The new screens for online personal banking are childish and hard to navigate.  I hate the way that you can only see about your last 3 transactions for each account and the silly micky mouse boxes for inputting data.  It is really childish and unfriendly if you need to see more information on your account.  Come on HSBC go back to the old one which was actually built for grown ups to use - this update is NOT and improvement.            
                HSBC state that the new internet site is "improved".Have they tried to use it?The old one was easier to use, showed more information and was faster.The new one is slow, visually very  poor and hard to navigate .            
                My daughter was the first person to get the new updated online banking from HSBC.She struggled with it and could not make head nor tail of her accounts.I have to say with regret that I am equally hacked off with the new design.   Why on earth would HSBC spend money on this utter pointless waste of time? Designed clearly by a moron with no thought whatsoever for those of us who have to use it.    I struggle to transfer money, find payees, pay people or just use the site with any efficiency.  The site is fiddly, gimmicky and no doubt makes some IT nerd feel good.Unfortunately it just makes me feel irritated, and as a consequence, in the last month or so, I have not used this banking site for much.   Only for the essential banking that I need.I shall consider leaving HSBC because of it.The other banking programme was much better, quicker and easier to understand.I cannot imagine what other people think of it.Another pointless waste of investors money courtesy of HSBC.            
                Am I the only one who thinks the new website enhanced banking is not easy on the eye it's not user friendly IMO to much information to digest the web site takes a while to log on using an iPad the transfer boxes at the bottom don't work properly I have numerous accounts but it only showed my main account .Thankfully it lets me switch back to the old non complicated mobile website this middle aged man does not like change I like user friendly banking .            
                Been with hsbc for 10 years-ish and liked the previous simple website. I can't even set up a new payee on this updated version, the rolling screens are irratating and have been trying to find a company payee but search won't pick up name and cannot scroll through list.  Mobile banking is meant to make our lives easier.            
                This new layout is awful!  Simplistic it's not.  I would dread to have to set up a new payee using the secure key on this.  I wouldn't know where to start.  It's put me off using it but of course I've got to.  Surely they should consider the user when they come up with these new designs!  My confidence in paying bills on there now is shattered as I'm scared I'll end up sending the money elsewhere!! HSBC why have you done this?  Not happy!            
                The new website is very user unfriendly and difficult to navigate around.  A school kid could do better.  As for the call centre what a joke as you are kept waiting for a very long time before the phone is answered and then the person gives the incorrect information.The website change is the last straw and we will be changing banks and wil looking for one with a call centre local to the UK.            
                I applied on-line to open a business bank account. Good experience going through the on-line bit but then, I tried to call the contact centre to arrange an appointment in branch (as requested by them).Ridiculously long hold time. I assumed lots of people were trying to get through but once I got on the phone, the advisor was so very slow, gave inaccurate information and just downright uninterested. Anyway she booked an appointment for me and now checking my email can see she's confirmed me for the wrong time. So, have tried to call back .. 18 mins have now passed so, I'm off to apply for a business account with my own bank. Slightly less perks in their business bank account offering but never have I had to wait as long or had to deal with such an uninterested customer service rep. If anything happened with my account, I can only imagine how awful it would be trying to get hold of them by phone. AWFUL, AWFUL!! And waste of my time.            
                On line banking down for a week, bills to pay but no access to my account. customer service simply lie if you ever get through to their Asian call centre. Seems to me they are deliberately trying to get rid of their personal customers ! They have lied to me and third parties. They do not answer correspondence except for generic acknowledgements.            
                The new website is rubbish, rolling screens, takes ages to find anything, accounts shuffled around. This is not user friendlyPlease bring back the old version. Although this is being sent to HSBC nobody will take notice of their customer.            
                I have been on hold for over 50 mins and still no answer! They should at least give you an average wait time. I don't have the option to go to a branch or call during the day. They make promises to call and don't fulfill them.            
                HSBC don't seem to be interested that people using their accounts are perpetrating a fraud.I made a payment to an HSBC Bank Account in the name of Redondo.  While their disputes department (tel: 0345 6090712) confirmed the account existed when I informed them it was being used to perpetrate a fraud the customer service adviser (Tina) was not interested in helping me as I was a Lloyds Bank customer.  When I asked if HSBC would freeze this account immediately to prevent any remaining proceeds of crime being removed she put me on hold for 30 minutes when I eventually gave up, as she had probably planned.Very poor service and a complete disinterest in HSBC Bank Accounts being used to perpetrate Fraud.            
                Am very disappointed with the new website to manage my money. Takes ages to load data everytime change screens. Rolling screens are nightmares. Finding payee awful.  Not impressed at all. I have been a customer for 40 years but if this does not get better I will be leaving.  Does HSBC really think this is an improved site?????            
                The 'new' online website is horrendous to navigate, rolling screen shooting back and forth. Reshuffled order of my accounts and removed the names they were listed as making it more difficult to quickly select accounts I want to access. So many issues with the new systems but I'm too irritated to spend any longer thinking about them alongside the amount of time even trying to log on! Instead I'll spend my time researching which bank to move to!!!            
                Customer of more than 30 years with 20k in their accounts. They blocked my cards because of some scheme called "Safeguard". Fair enough, but after eight calls from abroad and over Â£30 in call charges, I couldn't get them unblocked. Contradictory information from call centre employees, email requesting an appointment routed to the wrong department, repeatedly put on hold for 15 minutes at a time, broken promises - the lot. I eventually had to beg a friend to lend me money to buy a train ticket to go back home - it cost me Â£100 more than it should have done. Truly awful and humiliating experience.            
                It's really difficult to find the information you need on the website, and the layouts are terrible. Apart from that, they encourage the online application but make yourselves a favor and avoid it at all costs. Or go to another bank. It is taking me almost 2 months to open up a business account. And the help is close to non existent, as I spent already hours trying to get to someone by phone because the lines are always busy.            
                Rolling screens, background pictures and a myriad of boxes! The new website looks more like the PowerPoint presentation of an over enthusiastic school child, rather than the website of a multimillion Â£ banking company! Stop paying webdesigners millions to get creative and just provide something functional, less likely to trigger a migraine and a heck of a lot easier to navigate! Utter rubbish!!!            
                The communication at HSBC bank with regards to opening the advance account has been nothing short of shocking both in terms of the timescale and the responses. Having dealt with them over the last couple of weeks I am scratching my head at the high customer service scores I have been seeing for the bank on other websites.            
                Applied for a mortgage 4 months ago and told it would take 6-8 weeks and still dragging their feet. After a call today and the documents have just been sitting there for 12 days untouched we've been assured (again) it will be in the next 2 to 3 days. Avoid.            
                Pointless having one as they keep you on hold all day . I've been on hold well over an hour a number of times and ended up giving up . In fact it's that bad I've never actually spoke to someone on the phone before .            
                The website is god awful. Not only is the login restrictive with the stupid key system compared to every other online banking - but their most recent overhaul of the site now means that I cannot log in half the time. And you can't even click on Contact HSBC because the site failing to load doesn't allow you.            
                Terribly bad customer service; unhelpful, dismissive and even scoffed at the thought of me switching bank. Not sure if this is a cultural problem throughout the bank but something needs to be changed.Honest advice to those considering HSBC..find another bank. It's really just not worth going with them. I'm switching out.            
                Broadstairs branch NO tellers. Machine only. put notes only in machine, it counts it, wont accept tiny creases, ink marks, folds e.t.c. Staff will not change them, you have to go out and find a shop that will. you need to go in there with more than you need to pay a bill as you WILL have problems.The coin amount has to go in another machine wont give change neither will staff.. Put in your details again, that was  broke ,the staff knew about it being broke but left it. It then  worked, cut me off cos I was taking too long.,After 20 minutes it was done,I got a phone call from the people I had paid, that the coin amount was missing.Bill not paid.Staff like the new system as it means they get to work 3 long days, so dont pass on customers frustrations.two staff were obviously trained to say all the customers liked it . The lady behind me shouted "I dont" followed by responses of agreement from almost everyone in there, embarrassing for staff.!!            
                Everything is 3 days more very unhappy it's taken over 2 months to set a business account up and all they do is pass you person to person who give you wrong information it is a bad idea to apply online don't try it!!            
                i have been a HSBC account holder since the days of midland bank back in the early 80s (that's 1980s, not 1880s!), but due to a series of events, ranging from my debit/credit cards being constantly blocked due to "irregular activities", which included the purchase of a train ticket to rejecting my mortgage application. funny how they were more than happy laundering billions from drug cartels, but didn't want a penny from a law abiding, hard working customer.thanks to HSBC restricting transfers of Â£10k to once a day, i had no choice but to pay Â£30 to transfer money to my solicitors as i was buying a property. yes HSBC, i had no problem in securing a mortgage with Nationwide. the final straw came when i was refused  the transfer as my driving licence had my old address, not the one HSBC had on record. i was forced to return with my passport, which doesn't even have my address on it! thanks for nothing Hounslow HSBC. oh, and to cap it all, the person who finally dealt with me said it didn't even matter about the address on the driving licence. i can only conclude the "lady" who sent me away did it out of spite as we initially clashed on the first meeting.so, yeah, i've moved all my money over to Nationwide and as a bonus, was awarded with Â£250 for having a mortgage with them.            
                I not UK based, but have a UK Visa card issued by HSBC UK. On trying to set up Android Pay with this HSBC CR card, I was required to make a call to 03456002290, which is data pushed back to my Android phone by HSBC UK. Having found an alternative number for o'seas clients off a web search site, I then called the 44 1226...number and spoke to a human being. I gather from the individuals at HSBC that this initiative involved on-line banking, but I explained that I did not have an on-line banking issue with HSBC UK. I explained that I needed to go thru the verification steps for my HSBC UK card for Android Pay. This was too hard for the person and they then went on to say the line quality was poor and that they could not hear me. I gave up. I ask HSBC to sort out their Android Pay, without their customers either giving up on the process, or having to go thru hoops.            
                Have moved my 5 accounts to Santander - In November last year they were unable to organise a new Ltd bank account, with delays of two months and disjointed letters, advice and requirements, and eventually insisted I needed to visit a branch in person - they made an appointment for me over a month later in January!!!.  Given that I had 5 accounts with them already, why was this so hard.  Within 20 minutes, on the telephone, I had a new account set up with Santander.Also, why why why do HSBC ALWAYS have a minimum delay time on their customer service phone line - get more staff HSBC!  It is not a high volume of calls that causes the problem, it is a low staff count!!!Goodbye.            
                There's an option to sign onto online banking without your secure key - however, this service does not actually work. Instead it just freezes/breaks your computer and phone everytime you try to use it.            
                went in with two cheques to pay in no pay in book very helpful and customer focused            
                I have just spent 15 minutes and 21 seconds on the phone with these idiots in order to confirm my identity.Believe me or not their Fraud team failed to ask me my name or basic details before then asking me about transaction.  The idiot even said, 'so can you confirm that you attempted a transaction for Â£126.00 with(company name withheld)?'  My response, 'Yes!  That it the one you blocked because you considered it suspicious, the only thing suspicious activity was that your block meant I tried it several times and no-one notified me!'They even said log in and view transactions via on-line statement so that you can answer more questions???Please!!!  If you suspect activity on my account why then ask me to log into the account to confirm transactions.  If I was a hacker, do you not think I would access account and simply recount what is there.  Fools.Totally unbelievable!!!  Beware... these idiots are protecting your money.            
                I've tried for 4 months to reactivate my account after they barred it for some reason. I don't live in the UK, so I couldn't go to a branch there. The helpdesk cant help, customer complaints don't / can't help, they don't allow you to phone a branch ( branches don't have published telephone numbers, and the helpdesk wont give them to you ).... its impossible !!! In utter frustration  I wrote to 4 directors separately to try and get some help. Eventually someone in the Complaints department contacted me and my problem is now being resolved ( I hope). They are a hopeless bunch. I am closing my account and its strictly , anyone but HSBC in future.            
                I have had nothing but trouble with hsbc, I closed my account with them a while ago do to fraud being made on my account. After 4 pages of cash back transactions being made in 1 store and no stop being put on my account over a thousand pound was taken from my account. After being caught on cctv, prisoned and crime reference number was given I was still held reliable, don't trust this bank with your money!            
                I had a Premier account with HSBC for few years. They closed all my accounts without a reason with the promise that they will send the money back within 10 days by cheque. Not only I have not received any cheque after 15 working days, they also do not issue any emergency cash or even try to resolve any problems.            
                I got told a payment would be distributed and I was waiting for the distribution team to call back and when they did the lady said that they can not distribute the payment and I couldn't understand a word she was saying they need English speakers on the phone            
                Been with HSBC for over 30 years.Recently they sent me a letter advising that I'd recently updated my personal details, which I hadn't.This caused me some concern. Oh, a quick(!!!!) call to HSBC should clear up matters. Silly me! After over an hour on the phone, speaking to an overseas adviser and manager, the problem still wasn't rectified.I was told that they couldn't give me an explanation of the letter and they would have to log my query as a complaint, which it had not started out as. I would then need to wait 5 workings days just for an acknowledgment to my complaint(query). I've now switched banks - not something i'd thought of doing before.Don not touch these incompetents            
                I banked with HSBC for a few years and can say that they were the worst bank I have ever came accross. The staff in banks accross London is mainly incompetent and is not capable of dealing with customer enquiries. I had various issues with them some of them solved because they realised the mistakes they've made but the cost of this was very high. I have stressed and got angry over and over again until I finally closed my account.WORST BANK EVER, I feel that words are not enough to describe how terrible HSBC is.            
                Living in a small market town - as we do, that lovely caring bank "the HSBC" has decided to close all local branches with the exception of Sheffield centre and Barnsley town centre. Great, we now have no non town centre branches within 25 miles of here!As I will not enter into internet banking as HSBC stridently makes every effort to force us into, telling us at the same time â âif you are defrauded it is my fault for not having a safe enough passwordâ. Anyway I like to pay my credit card off in full each month, in person, at a branch, talk to someone, get a receipt and so now am required to take well over an hour, probably nearer two out of my life each month to trek into Barnsley, pay a parking fee and walk up mount Everest to achieve this once pleasurable experience â they donât even want the customer in the bank in Barnsley â no tables to write cheques on, little poker faced storm troopers stood in the bland reception showing little or no interest in the customer unless you fall for their well rehearsed sales pitches regarding internet banking.Getting very tired of this non customer friendly routine I decided to pay a sizeable building society check into my credit card account to be relieved for a few months running my life to suit the HSBC's profit margins. The most rude bored looking counter clerk interrogated me as to why I was doing this, how dare I and that this is not how I am supposed to run a credit card account. Excuse me, I'll run it how I want not how some ignorant junior member of staff perceives how I should run my affairs. Disgusting!!!I shall without doubt be moving banks (for the first time in over 30 years) to any other that offers a counter service/customer service and facilities convenient to myself (only a customer). I am fortunate that I owe the world not a penny and so do not have to put up with this greedy capitalism at its worst. Bring back the Midland Bank where the customer was king.            
                After banking with HSBC for over 15 years- I feel must warn anyone from banking with them.. I had ongoing issues with this bank treating me like dirt so often that I now believe the telephone hold music ( which has been the same for at least 10 years)  is designed to torment and discourage people from  contacting them... presumably because they have to deal with so many complaints... a subtle conspiracy against the spirits of millions.They will attempt to manipulate you and discourage you from gaining any information from them, in almost every scenario you could imagine. I recommend anyone having issues they deem legally dubious to go straight to the FCA or Financial Ombudsman for advice on how to communicate with them regarding the issue.I am currently waiting for them to review the validity of a default that appeared on my account, but it took about 8 phone calls to independent legal advisors to find a method of contacting the correct department, as anyone I called at HSBC would outright refuse to give me the information that it is my right to receive...I was told the default would be removed.. about 3 times within the same phone call, then I was later told I misunderstood this repeated confirmation, then I was told there was no point me providing any evidence to attempt to appeal the default and they were going to officially refuse to remove it. Then I was called back and  told they had actually decided to investigate it due to some irregularity with my account (?!?! No details provided). After complaining about this extreme attack on the defensive, its now been implied that dealing with my complaints regarding their irritate behaviour is actually slowing down the assessment of the actual default assessment and ORIGINAL COMPLAINT! This is complete customer disservice- but I must really clarify here, AFTER 15 YEARS I HAVE COME TO EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM HSBCAs I wait for HSBC to  form some ebb of moral compass and respond to me , my offer on my first home and my mortgage has fallen through...*AVOID* *AVOID* *AVOID*#mindblown#customerdisservice#ruininglivessince1865Safer to buy gold and wear as jewellery than bank with HSBC#Serious            
                I am honestly so surprised by my experiences with HSBC. I thought when I joined that it was a world-wide bank with good customer service. Until they left me stranded in a foreign country...I had been left stranded in Spain with no money because when I had opened my accounts a few months previously they had set up the wrong savings account. I was unable to access my money due to this. I would have been so screwed if I hadn't happened to overlap a day of my travels with my parents and they gave me cash. HSBC would not even let me close that savings account despite the dire situation because, well, they wanted a crap-tonne of paperwork for it! So I had to borrow money which would not have been there without my parents being there, pure luck, to last me the rest of my trip. Had to go into a branch and complain to get that falsely set up savings account closed, and finally get access to my money.My recent experience was more minor but is the straw that broke the camel's back, and I'm bloody moving banks now. Earlier this week I called up to ask how to generate a statement (couldn't find that option online, just my old other statements) and was told I can't do that, they have to generate it and send it to me. And charge me Â£1 while we're at it. Since I needed it desperately for a proof of address I conceded.They guaranteed it to be delivered to me on a certain day and that day passed with no such delivery to the bank. I complained for not only this, but I had found that I was charged Â£2 for my statement. I was on hold for a while as the person serving me kept trying to talk to different teams about my issue, but I was still refused a refund. He even gave me a solution to generate the statement by myself (when I was previously told I was unable to do this and forced to pay) and yet was still unable to give me my refund. So instead I agreed for him to set up a complaint ticket to be resolved in a swift 8 weeks! (Hope you caught the sarcasm there, this is ducking ridiculous.) I've been with a lot of banks, having moved to different continents, but never had I had such awful experiences than with HSBC.I am moving banks asap.            
                Two and a half years  with them and today I feel like I'll gonna break someone head. One week for an international payment and every day they pushed me another one or two days. The International payment team even are not talking with you. Bad,Bad,Bad. 2016 - London, when everything have to be on 'just push the button'. If you call the service on Friday, you prefer to die and not to wait for at least 50 minutes on the phone. On our money.I'm waiting for my payment to be made so I can close the account with them. They lose three customers at once.            
                For the second time in the last few years HSBC totally ignores it's customer base and designs a new interface which is just not fit for purpose.First we had the debacle over the fobs to sign-in ... extra security apparently (and yet HSBC was still hacked) and this was linked into the redesign of the LOGIN screen, which was appalling (white screen, multiple screens and a possible scroll!). I have been in the IT Industry since 1981 and it is without doubt one of the worse designs I have ever seen. I actually managed to get one of their lead technical people on the phone to discuss but guess what? no changes resulted.Then over the last couple of weeks we have been exposed to the new on-line system design (phased roll-out so you may not have it yet). it is even worse! it is terrible; takes 3 time longer to do anything; waste of space all over the place; stupid questions asked at the top of screens; account list in a different order, have to scroll and account names are missing. Zero customer input at all. Fortunately (and hopefully you have all seen this) a link has been added to the top left of the screen to revert to previous version. Guess what I do every time I logon?Do HSBC recognize their customers and ask them anything or simply let technicians design everything without input!To make matters worse, they announced today that they were closing my local HSBC branch; so now I can visit the faceless town center branch where all you are greeted by is a set of machines!            
                I have tried to call HSBC disputes department for over 1 hour now. This is ridiculous.            
                hsbc treat their customers with contempt.Been a customer for 15 years. now no business manager.Always wait at least 20 minutes for a call to be answered by a call centre operative or no answer to calls, telephone banking 'doesnt recognise me'the worst customer service possible. Use any other bank but not HSBC.Can't wait to leave as soon as I've set up with another bank.            
                Incredibly difficult to figure out how to do even the most simplest of things as well as being limited to pretty much only checking balances - Get with the competition HSBC!            
                I don't even want to wast emy time describing how disappointed I am with this branch, avoid it at all means            
                Hopeless. The phone service is like talking to analphabets. I had some basic questions about international business and multi-currency payments, any question more specific than the FAQs on the website will make your service person cry. Ridiculous waiting times and nothing like I expect from the business keeping my money, sorry guys, we ll have to split up.            
                If I could give HSBC less stars I would. it has been 5 weeks since I went into the bank to open a current account and I am still waiting! The lady that is dealing with my account takes an unacceptably long time to reply to my emails. When she does email me, she is unhelpful. She emailed me on Friday evening telling me to come back into the branch again on Saturday morning. I was away for the weekend and said I would not be able to unfortunately. She proceeded to call me on Saturday and emailed me to say that she had called to see where I was, despite my email to her the previous night. It is as if she expects me to jump through hoops for what I consider to be a basic service. The next available appointment is Thursday which I will attend, but I am strongly considering cancelling my application as it is getting ridiculous and I have not been apologized to for the inconvenience. Furthermore, it is obvious that the lady who I am dealing with does not care or put effort into her customer service as the emails I receive are ridden with bad grammar and sentences that make no sense. I am thoroughly disappointed with HSBC and would not recommend the bank to anyone.            
                I've been with HSBC for over 16 years and their online stuff has always floundered awkwardly and failed to deliver over and over. It's been nothing but an ongoing inconvenience for me for years. Whether it's trying to send some money to a friend using the app, or tallying your balance sheets for an end of year tax calculation, they make you jump through so many awkward and nonsensical hoops just to function. For this reason, I am perennially locked out of my account or forced to reset passwords or get new keys sent out or phone them to regain access. It's just a merry-go-round of poor service and the entire thing is pathetic. The annoying thing is it only takes 5 minutes using the service to see it's obvious and fixable flaws. How can they not know how bad it is? On any given day, sending a mate Â£20 direct can take from 20 mins to a couple of hours if it's a day that I haven't quite recalled one of my 3 or more passwords i have to remember just for HSBC! So frustrating, technology is supposed to make things simpler /end rant            
                Problem trying to open an account. They are unable to provide information on why it is on hold. They want me to go to branch but don't why or what information is  required. I have made a complaint which has not been dealt with within their own time frames. Can't get through on phone, managed once but she could not hear me as line quality is so poor. Worst bank by a mile.            
                My business bank account is with HSBC and I bank persoanlly with First Direct (who are excellent and part of the same group).  This year, HSBC closed my local branch and now I have to deal with a branch 10 miles away.  I recently had a low battery warning on my secure device - now I am locked out of my account, cannot ring my branch direct, over-complex reliance on codes with very unclear instructions, crashing website, astonishing attitude.  No human touch at all.  Looking at alternatives.            
                Apart from a few hiccups here and there I've generally had a very good experience.            
                The worst bank I have never had !To many codes and passwords to do something online!!!After tried to connect, with the digital code I had, my account has been locked one more time !!!!!Even in the agency everything is difficult within HSBCA misery!!!            
                They just don't answer the phone, and then you get cut off.   This is the worst service from any company I have dealt with.Update: After four attempts over two days and a total of two and a half hours waiting, they dealt correctly with my enquiry.Still awful!            
                Every time I contact HSBC with an issue (no matter how simple) I'm given the complete run around, passed from one department to another, nobody seems to know what they're doing. As others have said, the chat is completely useless, they just refer you on to a call centre and don't address your issue at all. Also, when they promise to call you back they never do. Utterly unacceptable way to conduct business!            
                They are the best banking service provider. Best customer services any time I was in need. Congrats!            
                Lost my digital secure key.  Went to branch to collect a new one thinking I was saving time but I still have to call to get an activation code.  Cannot get through.  Have wasted my last 2 days lunch breaks on hold to them.  Just rang now and receive lots of automated useless advice before being told they are closed.  No ring back options.  They really are appalling and I will definitely be closing my account            
                I left HSBC at the start of the year. I was sick them instantly dropping my ISA from the advertised rate to 0.5 or something similar. The call waiting times were and still are ridiculous, easily 20 minutes or longer for anything. The telephone banking number which seems unnecessary, on top on the Online username, password, memorable name, password for HSBC app to generate the secure key etc. I've since switched to First Direct, where my phone calls are always answered within 1 minute and customer service is UK based, not India / USA. It seems much more of a business / corporate orientated bank than customer orientated which First Direct seem to excel at.            
                I am writing on behalf of a friend who is not good with the English language. She went to withdraw her investment and found the money was gone and the account closed. The fraudsters who were known to her, presented faked ID credentials which the bank accepted as genuine, then forged her signature to withdraw the money. The HSBC's procedure for authenticating the ID was appallingly flawed, -anyone could have withdrawn the money! We visited the bank in Singapore, laid a police complaint and have been emailing and talking with the bank for over one year now without any success. We suspect that the bank are trying to keep is hushed. We would love to find someone within the HSBC who will come forward and resolve our problem            
                I've got an  bad experience with banking HSBC closing an regular saver took 7 days(Promised that it will be done in 2 days) which caused me late payment and been charged 42 pounds interest for an outstanding amount, although iv'e cleared whole before statement date .Once i reported the issue, they acted very quickly and refunded my amount and has taken necessary actions to avoid this kind issues in future, Very happy customer , secure and trust worthy.Thanks guys            
                Going through a mortgage application.. received numerous voicemails over the last couple of weeks about various details. But EVERY time I ring back,  I am made to wait ages for an answer..30 minutes is an average. I will take every effort in the future to avoid this company.            
                First of all I need to say that I am First Direct customer, which is part of HSBC group. First direct is amazing, the best bank for customer service. However, first direct doesn't do business banking and I thought to go its parent company, HSBC to open 2 bank accounts for a a couple of limited companies I run. After 6 months of submitting the applications I still haven't heard back from HSBC. I called them a number of times and every time they say they will call me back to let me know but they have never done so. Avoid HSBC like the plague unless you have plenty of time to waste.            
                Horrible experience, Basically after innumerable calls and visits to the branch and getting no clear explanation on why they wouldn't allow me to make use of my own money! Just because I'm new in the branch they wouldn't allow me to make a purchase of a large amount of money or enable a window to do so. Horrible, just a horrible experience. Felt played around passing me to one after another department and going back again and again to the branch. I will definitely close the account ASAP            
                Always polite and at your services            
                Customer service is non existent ! Called for help and advice relating to my mortgage and after being told someone would call back I had to go into a branch 4 days later only to be told they take at least a week to respond to a call back (this from a mortgage advisor in branch no less ! ) Eventually got sick of waiting and tried calling again ....got treated with utter contemp and not an ounce of customer service was shown .  Like robots reading from a script.  Not once was I able to discuss my reasons for calling after my first call . Then a week later they called me to try and sell me other products !! Unbelievable. Taking my business away as soon as I can .            
                I have been left without access to my debit card for 2 weeks now. Their help desk is absolutely desperate, incompetent and their online service is the least accessible i have seen in years. What a shame. Stay away guys !            
                This bank used to be good about 14 years ago... NOW - - - -Absolute crap! Hours on the phone talking to english speakers from a foreign country who have NO english verncular. Chat is a terrible experience... decieve you into believing you can get a transcript. Can't get any face time with local manager. Can't find your SO & DD information online. The incompetent stuff goes on and on and on. Totally un-professional and bleeding useless. I'm moving on!!!            
                I am holding on right now because I can't login to my online banking and I've been hanging on listening to a crackling inane racket for over forty minutes. I shouldn't even be surprised because for as long as I can remember its been like this. I desperately need to speak to someone and I can't.  My other half banks wirth Santander and gets through in less than a minute every single time she rings them.  I can't believe how long its taken me to decide but my HSBC account is going to be closed as soon as possible.  Utter utter joke, just not at all funny.....            
                1) Very difficult to communicate. LiveChat and internal messaging service always ask you to call the phone bank. But the lines are always busy.2) Internet bank requires tons of different passwords and mobile application. Also, it is poorly designed, has lots of obvious bugs and it is not working quiet often.3) Asked for debit card WITHOUT contactless. Got card WITH contactless anyway. Who cares?4) Asked to open Currency Account. Never heard from them for 3-4 weeks. The only way to check the status is to call the bloody callcenter, but I could not get through in reasonable time.5) No way to opt out of overdraft facilities. If you refuse to use the planned overdraft, they'll lend you money with unplanned overdraft anyway, and you'll pay 2-3 times more for it.6) Poor 3D Secure screen. It asks tons of questions, creates one more password (like I did not have enough passwords already) and then refuses the transaction anyway.They're doing great job at keeping customers out of their money and insulting them. Stay away. Hopefully, this "bank" won't survive the next financial crisis. World would be better without it.            
                Misleading and incorrect information with web chat and 40 minute hold time.Footprint on my credit rating from incorrect advise.Sending all banking details to wrong address - DPA.Online system problems with only one answer â Going into a branch.Misleading and incorrect that my address was changed - after taking time off work to go into the branch!False information given when told payments where set up when they were not!Lied when said would contact me within 72 hours. (FCA guidelines)Once calling back after one week with no contact from HSBC after raising the complaint. I was told that they would be in contact within one week and 8 days on still no contact from HSBC â Lied.            
                I won't bother to explain ALL the problems I've had with HSBC, just trust and believe me when I say they are beyond o competent! Useless don't touch them with a barge pole!!!            
                Absolutly usless, We've been told all credit checks / underwriting are accepted but we've been trying for a week and a half to find out when the hell we get the money, first the moron dealing with our application is on holiday ( Why do we care, in our jobs we have to arrange seamless cover ) then they say they'll contact us in 24 hrs  - nothing so we leave it 48hrs and call again and lo and behold they've passed it to another moron who's got the day off. I will never ever use these incompetent fools again and highly recommend you don't either their customer service is shambolic. Just for the record this is a remortgage of one of theirs and we had the same problems last time !            
                I opened my first adult account with these and from day one I had nothing but trouble. They threw a credit card at me and ended up taking my limit to Â£8500 in months and from then on I was in trouble. I ended up having loans to cover the credit card but they wouldn't close the empty account just left it open. They kept allowing my overdraft to be exceeded against my wishes and I was charged Â£150 a month in bank charges but when I questioned the legality of this recently, they said they only held 2 years of information as I was no longer with them and that they had won a court case saying it couldn't be challenged - I've since received advice from the financial ombudsman that this is a lie!!! Crooks!! They should be stopped.            
                My son having had his debit card swallowed by the ATM and the branch in Playa del Carmen saying they couldn't do anything about it I asked HSBC Premier to send a new card out to him at the HSBC branch in Playa.  Told it should take 10 to 12 working days but last week I got a letter to say the card was at the branch the account is in in Hertfordshire.  Having checked this was hopefully a mistake and it was on its way to Mexico it still hasn't arrived and HSBC bank staff in Mexico totally unhelpful and disinterested.  He's fast running out of ways to access funds but neither of us can find anyone at HSBC to help.            
                Not impressed at all that HSBC left me in a foreign country with children with no money. When I called for some help until I got paid in three days time I was told "there is nothing we can do, thank you" and then she hung up. We had an emergency on holiday and that is why I ran out of money, it was beyond my control, the full story was explained to them. So there I was in a foreign country unable to feed my young children and they absolutely didn't want to know at all. I am appalled. They are supposed to pride themselves on relationship and discretionary help for exceptional circumstances. It seems they are eager to help if you have money but not interested if you don't have much.            
                Kept on hold for over half an hour to reset my security details. When at last I got connected he cut me off immediately. A responsible person should phone back. Absolutely disgusting.Everything I want to do with this bank is difficult. It has been nearly three weeks trying to set up telephone banking, waisted my time going to the local branch twice and waiting for about two hours every time.Their mobile app is a complete failure as well as their customer server.            
                Absolutely untrained staff. If you go 3 times for the same reason and speak with 3 different staff member they say 3 different stories!            
                On Sunday night I noticed Â£350 taken from my account I was horrified.I called them straight away.It took 2 min to answer first call and about 5 min to be put through to the right team.I was told someone would call me back but decided to call them yesterday from my local bank.Waited about 7 min for someone to answer then a wait of about 15 min for him to sort something.Today at 6 in morn my Â£350 was back in my account has not even taken 3 days Thank you to all at the call centre for being so kind and sorting it so quickly for me.Well done to you all and much appreciated.            
                Due to the nature of my work, I had different accounts with banks in uk.Lately I ve decided to give HSBC a go. It was an application for current account.A month later I found out that I had a Hard credit search on my credit file.I have never had a had credit check on current account opening and with the other 2 banks I am using I have over Â£1000 overdraft availability on my current accounts.I will raise the matter to the regulator            
                Getting reliable service from 5 years. Thanks HSBC.            
                I went to open banks account , I have all paper with me , ID , full UK driving licence and they say no cause I'm not working for now therefor I don't need it ???? while ago I was there and other members told me also deference   reason . so I asked to speak to the manager they say no . very much feel discriminated by . the poor service. I went to Nat Natwest and open straight away.            
                Well that is the way it seems to me.  I applied to set up a currency account nearly 3 weeks ago and so far I have heard nothing from the bank about it at all.  Nothing.  This is despite the blurb saying that it would only take 2 or 3 working days to set up. Huh!  When I sent a secure email from within their online banking system to ask what was going on I was told that I had been sent a letter.  That was over a week ago now.  How was this letter sent I wonder, by tortoise mail perhaps?            
                Abandoned my current account there years ago due to poor service.Now only have a credit card.Use rarely, so can never remember online or phone passwords.Password reset process in unbelievably convoluted and involves calling the call centre (another forgotten password) - who never answer anyway.Will be cancelling the card now. Final straw.            
                Its been 7 days I am trying to contact hsbc vis telephone banking more than hour wait no answer finally I gave up now I will pop in to brach soon and will cancel my account worst telphone banking service please dont open you account with HSBC            
                Poor telephone service - almost every time I have phoned I have waited in excess of 25 minutes, today was no exception.   The "on hold" music is terrible and the sound quality of the music is something else altogether.   The quality of the service once you get through isn't bad but the waiting time to get to that justifies the 1 star.            
                Hours on phone waiting to get help and when you get through they are thick as mud, branches closing everywhere,none of the staff care about anything,still need paper paying in slips even though its 2016, cancelled direct debits still get paid out and the online banking is quite often a day behind the real world, HSBC is useless if i could rate negative stars I would rate HSBC - 25            
                HSBC added Â£800 to my credit card bill for no reason! Avoid.            
                Not just they didn't sent me my new card, now I have to waste my time waiting to have my problem sorted. Shouldn't be so difficult and the people working there needs to be more helpful.            
                Totally unacceptable wait time on phone. Even worse than tax office. On hold for 25 minutes then got cut off then on hold for 30 minutes!!!!  Will be switching when I get chance..            
                Why is every waking (and non-waking hour) of the day a 'high call volume' hour!!30 minutes on the phone and still no answer!!! And that music!! What the hell, at least get some music that doesn't sound like it is being played on a gramophone!! I'll be switching as soon as you answer and unlock my account!!            
                I have been kept on hold for 52 minutes and this seriously boring, and a waste of my time. Surely I will put through soon???? I am seriously unimpressed with HSBC right now.            
                On hold to customer services for over an hour very very very bad service. Sort it out!            
                Visited my local branch, unfortunately, I had a slightly complicated issue to resolve was refused to see a member of staff privately and the two rude and unhelpful staff spoke loudly about the issue I needed to resolve. I'm only giving one star because there is not the opportunity to give none            
                You should be treating lost/stolen card calls as a matter of urgency shouldn't you?Maybe you should hire some more people?Maybe you should stop playing the same frenetic violin music for 30 minutes on loop?Maybe you should just Answer. The. Phone.            
                I have tried switching to the HSBC account in order to move to a 'real' bank from one of the smaller guys.My issues so far:1) Online application, website crashed mid application had to wait extra week for team to find my application. Phone support rather rude when I asked for udates telling me I just have to wait untill they are done, no ETA.2) Switch Guarantee, switch date agreed, switch was supposed to be initiated 6 days before date and complete on date. A week and a half after switch date still nothing. Have missed 3 standing orders and after that been transferring money to old account manually to keep up. Tried to contact support was told I need to contact original bank to check on status. When enquired why I need to do this and that that is not what the 'switch guarantee' promissed, was told there is nothing I they can do and agent ended the call. (I did not swear, insult or otherwise give reason to do so).3) Tried to change the new account to a joint account. Chat support says I can initiate a joint account switch by phone, website says I can initiate by phone, phone support says website is wrong and need to go in branch. Branch unavaliable for almost 3 weeks. Phone support was polite this time.4) Tried to apply for new credit card for new account. Website crashed during application. No feedback from bank on status and unable to start new application. After hour on phone was told that as I CHOSE not to finish the application they will need at least extra week to process it themselves. No ETA, ws told just need to wait untill they are done.Without drawing general conclusions, I'm not very happy with the service I have received. Considering most suppliers try really hard with new customers I'm worried about the level of service I should expect once I'm 'settled' into the bank.            
                Applied for a personal loan as a non HSBC customer, as HSBC advertised rate is 0.3% better than my bank.Wish i never bothered.HSBC state a decision and contact within 5 days. Ive had no correspondence whatsoever (not even an automated email) when the application was submitted. 6 days later I decide to give them a call to find the status, On hold for 1 hour and I've still got the phone to my ear as I type this.Hopefully i can withdraw my application and borrow from my own bank.The worst banking experience I've ever had but hopefully a lucky escape I now know never to open an account / remortgage or any other transaction with HSBC Avoid at all costs.            
                Just spent 3x25 minutes trying to get my account unlocked. Don't know why it was locked in the first place!  I don't think Customer Service department exists so how can I rate it?And as for the music. The tape is obviously on its last legs and has a built in silent portion to fool you into thinking someone is about to answer. Will be moving my account to - anywhere!            
                This is literally the worst Bank I have ever dealt with. Here are the reasons:1.I applied for a credit card, and it took me days and hours and hours on the phone to verify one single thing. After one hour and a half on the phone, they said we need another form that I should fax or email. I did, and it took them a week to process it. No one called me. I called them, and they said we need two more days to make a decision. I called them after two days, and they said we call you back. They never did. 2.Each time you call, they transfer you to each other. From this department to another. Many times you successfully can reach to a correct representative but mysteriously it disconnects!!! Once I asked for a direct number they gave me a number that never worked. Never could dial it. The interesting part is that they still give you the same number for future calls. 3.If you live in the USA, do not apply for this Bank. I have 12 credit cards, and this is really the sickest and the worst bank I dealt with in my whole life. 4.Most of the representatives are polite and nice but the problem is the HSBC higher ranks and probably the stupid British laws and regulations caused this.            
                I have been an HSBC customer for my whole adult life and before that the Midland Bank. I regret that I have been subjected to the worst possible service and inconvenience. On 20th July I made an internet transfer 0f 300 Euros to pay for my pool fees in Portugal the deadline being 25th July. HSBC froze the payment and did not inform me until the afternoon of Friday 22nd July giving me virtually no time to sort the issue. Having been in branch for over 1 hour with still no resolution I was further held on the phone for 45 minutes on the 25th, another trip to branch where the assistant herself was on the phone for over an hour with three phones going and just ringing out to find that Audit and Compliance could not be reached!Today I receive a phone call saying sorry we will give you Â£100. This company has no idea the issue they have caused me. Firstly I now have to stump up 100 Euros to get my access cards un stunned, secondly as I am the only person who can do it I now have to travel to Portugal to get it done so airfare/parking and time from work and thirdly I have had to inconvenience friends who cannot now access the pool who are already there! HSBC think that this is acceptable and that leaving it 2 days to inform someone without any consideration of how important someone else business may be is unbelievable. For 11 years these payments have been managed by Halifax with no issue whatsoever and now putting all my eggs in one basket has come and bit me massively.I am sure that this would have been different if it was HSBC themselves up against an important deadline!! Your customer service is atrocious, waiting times completely unacceptable and I have absolutely no confidence in you managing my finances any longer!! Hopefully someone who cares about your clients will read this and make some changes but some how I doubt it.            
                I am now informed my Cheque Book will be reduced of Cheques,but I need a new Book and cannot get out ,so how do I go about getting  another one,.Cheques are handy when one has to send Gift money abroard.            
                Been trying to get through to customer services for 4 hours. Holding on each time for 30 mins. Still no answer. Will be changing banks!!            
                I'm sorry but cancelling a lost or stolen card should be a matter of urgency for any bank. To wait 20 minutes to cancel my card is not acceptable. What makes matter worse is that based on the fact I had to cancel a different card a 6 months ago and they said they were working on the issue and we are now 6 months on and the same issue is present shows they are evidently not working on the issue. FSA should be investigating the negligence with people finances.            
                Had an appointment to open a business and received a letter confirming this. Left my office a drive 10 miles, parked in Gloucester town centre and walked to the bank. On arrival I was told by the 'hostess' that the person I was due to meet had been off sick for several weeks. Nobody notified me and no one was available to see me. Poor girl on the front was left to deal with my annoyance by her self. Terrible            
                It takes SO long to get through to customer service and I always seem to have problems with my online banking. If you could speak to a human within half an hour it wouldn't be that bad but I always have to wait on hold for over an hour.            
                I have been an HSBC customer for 15 years and hadn't had any issues up until the last couple of years. Since they have introduced the new digital secure key everything has gone downhill rapidly. Unless you have an amazing memory for a stack of passwords and memorable answers to hand every time you need to do anything then don't bother with mobile banking. And God forbid you ever forget your password or input it incorrectly too many times because you will have to call them, and then you really lose the will to live. They then have to reset everything and send you codes (which took 10 hours to come through to me by text last time I had to do it, luckily I didn't hold on the phone like she asked me to until the code came through!). I have had to reset my account so many times that I don't feel I could actually do it again. I cannot remember which passwords go with my account or my secure key, and it will not let you use a password that you have used before. when I told this to the lady on the phone she snapped 'well haven't you got it written down? but I thought you were encouraged by banks not to write passwords down????I understand that they need security but the level of security they are asking for is ridiculous, and when you can't even log into your own account then enough is enough. I am moving my account elsewhere this week. Bye bye HSBC :)            
                I lack the energy to write a detailed account of the hell that has been being an HSBC customer who lives away from access to a local branch. Every time their online banking service inexplicably offers error messages and directs you to call their 'help' desk - you run the risk of being blocked from telephone banking - because they can't put you through to online banking to check the meaning of an error message or to check for outage on the system without going through the telephone banking process which requires a different set of passwords from your online banking details. In my case I offered 5 of the 6 memorable answers they asked for and still was told I was blocked since I could not give a 'memorable' word. Even though the person could not even give me a question like first school, first dog etc. Even he apologised saying that it was ridiculous since I could quote every assess I had ever been registered at and every card linked to the account and the last debit and credit. The only option is to go into a bank in person which is not possible in my case as I am currently working abroad. I understand that security is important but this is beyond ridiculous. It seems like it would be easier to hack into the IT system of the Pentagon than to reset a security password with HSBC. I am coming back to the UK in August because I am forced to show up at a bank in person. I will be taking the opportunity to close my account and find a bank not located in the Stone Age or run by people who prefer to treat their customers like criminals.            
                These new secure key and passwords are so much hassle! Locked again and only way to re-activate is call! Ok I'll call! On hold earlier today for 20 minutes no joy! Now been on hold 25 minutes and still not through! Come on HSBC this is ridiculous! Been a customer for over 20 years, no hassle ever getting through but the last few months atrocious! I understand you want us to use technology, however when I can't reset something and NEED to speak to you would be nice to not have to wait! This phone call isn't one of choice, I'd much rather be doing it all online!!!!            
                Are you kidding me, HSBC is rude and terrible.            
                I have been with HSBC for 49 yrs and for the last 10 years a Premier account Customer. I was recently offered, via the Internet banking, an HSBC  loan at 3.3 % as a Premier Customer and decided to take advantage of this offer. I went into my local Bromsgrove Branch to apply for this offer, but to my surprise, on completing the application on line I was told that yes I could have the loan, but it would be at 6.7%. On querying as to why I didn't qualify for the advertised rate the the assistant was unable to give me an explanation, but said that very few people received the 3.3% rate. I demanded to know the reason why I was not given the advertised rate. Eventually I was referred to a Manager and she again could not understand as on examining my financial committments it was obvious that I had no problems in meeting the monthly repayments and she agreed to take the matter up . Eventually after 4 days she came back to me with no explanation, other than a  number of rather ambiguous excuses, as to why I couldn't have the loan at the advertised rate. None of these was regarding my financial abilty to repay the loan. It was obvious that the advertised rate of 3.3% interest is just being used to draw in customers, with HSBC having absolutely no intention of lending money at this rate.  So be very aware of this extremely misleading advertisement. Oh yes HSBC I will be taking my custom elsewhere, obviously 49 years of loyalty means nothing to you.  Thank you very much for nothing !!!!            
                I was with HSBC for 9 years. In my time with them i got shockingly poor customer service (lets hope they didnt treat their family the same way they treat their customers). I received over Â£2700 in overdrafts charges. Some of which were charges for them taking their charges and pushing me further into debt. I tried several times to speak to someone regarding my finances to be told that its tough, its my problem, i'll have to deal with the charges myself. It got to a point where my overdraft limit was Â£100 but somehow i was able to got over this by Â£760, which meant i was Â£860 ovedrawn in tootal. Then on top of that they took their Â£150 overdraft fee's and charges me for the privilidge of now being  Â£1010 overdrawn. At this point i would have recieved my wage and had nothing to live on as the previouis month was partly my fault but mainly theirs. I pleaded with managers and advisors alike for help and was refused. I had no choice but to swap bank account to another provider. Leave that account in negative balance and go on an IVA to fix my finances. This has left my credit rating in a bad way and is constantly affecting my future and will do for another 4 years as of me writing this. Thanks for nothing HSBC. My advice to anyone that is looking to get an account with them is this. DONT. YOU WILL REGRET IT. If i could then i would take them to court over how thy treated me and the long term damage they caused me. The above is my warning to you. Please take head of my advice.            
                Trying to open a business account.  Actually only need a Euro account but have to open a Stirling account too.So jump through their hoops and sit waiting for somebody call me at a time scheduled by themselves to go through the account set up.  No call from HSBC at specified time.So call them to ask why they have not called me.  Hold for 15 minutes before they answer then hold for 5 minutes whilst he tries to find an answer.  Person who was supposed to call me is not in.  Will not be opening a business, or any account with this bank.            
                Cannot describe how frustrating this bank is,untrained telephone staff, on hold for over 55 mins to try and reset security details again !!closing account tomorrow....            
                Time waiting is ridiculous, time to move banks to first direct what it a department of HSBC with calls answered within 30 seconds and is in the same building            
                Need a new secure key ( that's another story) and so far no joy tried 3 times 40 mins,  30 mins and now as I type 15 mins.  Really poor service,  Santander were much better when I needed them. Stuck with hsbc as they have my mortgage which is not worth switching.            
                Perhaps, instead of using all the billions of profits to pay fines for illegal practices and paying huge bonus', you could invest a tin percentage of this in some more staff to take customers queries. After using a code generator supplied by your good selves it managed to lock me out of my own account, unable to transfer funds, and now waiting 45 minutes for someone from HSBC to answer the phone. Hopefully Santander or any other bank will offer a better service, after I have closed my accounts with HSBC, they surely couldn't  be any worse            
                Wait for ever. Worst bank surely. 3 weeks to open an account and waiting            
                customer service staff seem untrained incompetent and unable to assist with anything, making any contact for help, utterly pointless..are there only two if them? call waiting times are also intolerable and a hindrance to my business.what a shame... the person I did get through to after days of calling, their English was not very clear and they were eating while speaking to me, which not only made it difficult to understand but quite disgusting to have to listen too....            
                The phone banking debacle is now costing me money...... HSBC answer you dammed phones...who has 25/50mins to wait for somebody to decide to answer the phone... HSBC I HATE YOU.... #HATEHSBC #HELLOHSBC #PICKUPYOURPHONES            
                I needed an urgent business transaction/payment to be made, spoke to a representative who was not able to help in any way. Although having a substantial amount of money in the account it was impossible for me to make a payment over 10k and she could not even say when we could access our money.            
                I am a HSBC Customer for over 20 years and have to say they seem to be going from best Bank to worst in those 20 years they have  Closed my Local Branch down ( which was open for over 50 years) |I am a Advance banking Customer  that means u pay extra for what it used to be for UK call centres now mainly have Calls answered from Countries other then UK , who  i don't understand when they SpeakI have had tried to Explain my View to the Bank but its on Deaf Ears            
                I've been listening to the dreadful waiting music loop for 20 minutes now. Not being told where I am in the queue is infuriating, and the music has become torturous. As a paying customer, this seems particularly egregious.            
                Terrible customer service...been on hold now for 30 mins...            
                Everytime I call, I have to wait at least 40 to 50mn at least. not sometimes but every single time. If you like being on the phone listening to the most irritating piano music looping and looping again with hope fading of ever getting through to a human being then this is the bank for you.            
                This bank is a disgrace and deserves no stars, do not bother ringing there customer services keeped waiting for 3 hours, emailed 5 times no reply had enough closing account.            
                If you like being on the phone listening to the most irritating piano music looping and looping again with hope fading of ever getting through to a human being then this is the bank for you.  If only they answered the phone with the same attention to detail as they do making all sorts of outragous charged to my account then it would be answered within three rings not three hours            
                I went in branch to upgrade my account and I was told the wrong information at several times during the process which ended up taking weeks. They told me my card would arrive in the post but it arrived at a branch in a city I don't even live in and customer services took 30 mins to answer for me to get it sent to a more convenient branch. They cancelled my old card when they told me that it would stay active until I activated my new card. HSBC is my main current account but they left me without a card for almost a week - I don't they how they expected me to function without access to money. Their staff need better training.            
                Everytime you call message says over 25 minute wait!! EVERYTIME!!  I had charges applied to my account which shouldnt have been put on. When I complained they took them off and said if I got a letter to say if I got a letter for charges for next month to call them back and they would get taken off. I did indeed get a letter and called them (another 30 minute wait!) and they now refuse to take them off! W****KERS!!            
                I had the most dreadful experience registering my Mother's death in the Royston branch. The staff were rude, dismissive, cold and unfeeling. They were deliberately obstructive and when I refused to stay and be spoken to in that way I had to watch the copies they had made of the death certificate being torn up theatrically and dropped Into a bin. I was reduced to tears by this and then couldn't get my complaint taken seriously for weeks. An awful experience.            
                Won't even bother with the details... Same as everyone else.            
                I managed to lock myself out of my online banking (my stupid fault), so called the number to unblock it, after waiting on hold for 55 minutes finally got through to someone who then proceeded to block my account because I could not remember what i spent Â£11.11 on last week. Offered another option to call a different number, then promptly blocked my account again because i could not answer when my account was set up. Iv had it since i was 11ish, how am supposed to remember the date. All in all, the app is rubbish, the online services are rubbish, the customer services are rubbish. HSBC are rubbish and I am already in the process of changing bank.            
                I have banked with HSBC, formally the Midland Bank, since I was 16 years of age. I am now 43 years old. I'm leaving this bank now. Tonight I'm typing this review with one hand and the other holding my mobile, calling HSBC's telephone banking because I know this call will take forever. The automated service told me 'calls are taking in excess of 6 minutes to be answered you may wish to go online.....' Well I can not. I do not have a choice, my secure key is broken and I need to make payment this evening. (40 mins still holding)It's been like this with HSBC Telephone Banking for months now. Clearly they only want you to bank with them via the internet.Be warned though. If for any reason you can't use Internet Banking. You are in for a terrible experience I had this same problem about a month ago. After holding on the phone for over an hour. I hung up. So, I thought I'd kid the system. I decided to call again to report my card being stolen. This way I thought I would be speak to someone quickly.No!Telephone Banking automated system told me to call back tomorrow.Er.. Stolen Card.. Fraud... Theft.Based on the reviews I have seen on Trustpilot they clearly do not care.52 minutes still holding....A not fit for purpose service            
                I called HSBC after being inexplicably locked out of my Internet Banking account. After waiting for what has now become the customary 30+ minutes, I was put through to someone who assured me he could help, 'de-registered' me from the system and told me to sign up again. I attempted this about 8 or 9 times, but each time I got an error message from the website at some point in the process. After this, I'm fairly certain the customer services agent simply got bored and decided he wanted to get rid of me. I heard him move away from the phone/take off his headset (do they think we can't hear this?), and then when he returned he repeatedly said he couldn't hear me (though I was clearly speaking) and that he would have to terminate the call because he was getting no response. This is an absolutely OUTRAGEOUS tactic, and I am now waiting (wasting!) a further 30+ minutes of my time to give someone a piece of my mind.HSBC - a continually faulty website, terrible waiting times for phone assistance and the absolute bare-faced GALL to pretend the phone line isn't working when they get bored of speaking to customers. Appalling. I will be leaving this bank as soon as is convenient, though I dread to think of the headache trying to move will cause.            
                I have just left HSBC after 7 years of loyal custom & my reason for leaving is the unreliable customer services on the telephone, you are on hold for at least 30 minuites, no message to let you know where you are placed in the queue & overseas call centres, there is plenty of other banks out there that do a far better job than HSBC, glad to see the back of them.            
                I was on to an answering machine for 45 minutes last night 8.6.16 before giving up and now tonight again 40 minutes before giving up. Im not sure anyone actually works there.            
                Title says it all, HSBC has become really bad with customer service off late. Banked with them for over 10 years, now they have given me no choice but to switch to another bank.            
                been on now for 57 minutes when it said a 6 minute wait. Absolute disgrace .            
                how long should anyone have to wait to talk to their bank.... absolute rubbish            
                made me wait over 30 mins just to say call back tomorrow. this is a joke. wasting my credit smh            
                40 minutes on the phone only to get no answer making me have to go to my branch the following day to sort out a problem over cash point .still not resolved will I get my cash back or will I have to take legal action.            
                They have to be the worst bank in the country. Their systems are overly complex and their staff generally unhelpful.  Just tried using their telephone banking to transfer money to a different bank - gave up waiting for an operator.  Tried to do it myself online and because I have a new phone they need to send me a new code by POST!!!! what age is this bank living in!!!!!!!!!!!.            
                They should be ground into the dirt beneath the bootheels of better men. All I wanted was a replacement for the f**king nightmare c**ting, c**ting secure pin device and they don't even have the decency to answer their m**herf**king phones. 25 godforsaken minutes I was waiting to speak to these c*nts and nothing. They don't even deserve my spite. And while I'm on here, what is the point of that c*nting secure pin in the first place? No other bank has it and it is the bane of my life - I despise it.            
                No one has been answering the phones for over a week on their 0345 customer services number.When on their 0845 revenue sharing number,I timed the wait,and was usually answered just before 5 minutes.I thought it quite odd and waited for 5 minutes to pass  for a response,which I usually got.Of course,it may have been pure coincidence.            
                HSBC are now beyond useless.            
                Appalling service from HSBC. Took them over 25 mins to answer their 'misleading' Customer Service Line. An arrogant, complacent and unacceptable level of service from a bank that claims to be local. Thank god it only takes 7 days to move a bank account.            
                My card pin is locked due to a cash machine issue. I have been trying by to contact HSBC now for two days at various times and at all times they are experiencing high call volumes with a thirty minute wait. I have waited over an hour and have had to hang up!I'm spending the weekend at home because I do not have any chance to get cash.Current service or however you shoud call it more appropriately is certainly not acceptable and should not be considered as norm by HSBC! Several internet forums are discussing about this awful Customer Service. I am extremely disappointed to hear that discussions.            
                Total rubbish - over 30 mins waits for answer to calls.  Don't bank with these jokers - has an account fir over 20 years but now thinking of moving            
                I (stupidly) took a credit card with HSBC for balance transfer purposes. Worse banking decision I made. Contacting them is nigh on impossible - every time I've had to call them it's taken at least 45 minutes to speak to a human being. When I have got through, getting passed from pillar to post is the usual experience. You can't pay money towards your credit card online, and you can't do it at a branch - the only way to do it is via direct debit, so if you want to pay more one month, forget it. Not only that, customers have to call an 0345 number, costing a lot of money for a 45minute call. Your best bet is to call the 01442 number for overseas customers. Rather than call you, they'll text you and ask them to call these 0345 numbers. Grr...makes me angry just thinking about it! was so incensed after waiting another hour on a call this morning (total of 2 hours of my life this week) that I've arranged another credit card to transfer my hsbc balance to. i'd rather poke my eyes with hot needles than bank with this company another minute longer.            
                My son's bank card stopped working so I tried to call HSBC. It was impossible to get through.He doesn't have Internet banking as he is too young, so my only option is to go into the branch, which doesn't open at the weekend.Like the previous review I read, I think we will leave the minimum amount in the account and move his banking elsewhere.            
                I've given up trying to reach them by phone. After over an hour on hold I'd had more of that stupid music than I could bear. I'll leave a nominal amount in the account to stop them closing it and cost them money in administration. I'd have more chance of getting a straight answer from David Cameron than this bunch.            
                I have been trying by to contact HSBC now for three days at various times and at all three times they are experiencing high call volumes with a thirty minute waitI have waited over an hour and have had to hang up! And to send a complaint u need 5 days before someone gets back to you..But if you owe the bank money the amount of letters text and phone calls you receive are ridiculous, but when you need someone there is no one there..            
                Where on earth do you to be answered in more than one hour.... Absolutely ridiculous going to close my account            
                Have called on several occasions,early morning,midday,mid-afternoon and evening.Every time a recorded message telling me they are experiencing high call volume and I will have to wait around 25 minutes for my call to be answered!.I find this both ignorant and insulting,I have another account with Nationwide and they answer straight away.Will be closing my hsbc account ASAP.            
                One star seems generous in the extreme. This bank truly rates as one of the worst customer experiences of all time.How can a business that generates so much cash, yet provides such rubbish customer service be in business at all!            
                I've been a customer of HSBC for 20 years now and customer service has never been this bad!The service at branches is not great, unhelpful and sometimes hostile staff, however waiting time on the phone to speak to someone is almost an hour which is an utter joke!!! It should not be called a service as there is none!Current service or however you shoud call it more appropriately is certainly not acceptable and should not be considered as norm by HSBC!I do hope feedback left will be used by relevant body to speak to HSBC management to take urgent action!            
                I've been trying to get through to HSBC for 2 days now. Was on hold for 50 minutes yesterday before having to hang up as I had an appointment and then on hold another 40 mins in the evening from 8:20 to 9pm before being cut off. Phoned today around 11:40am and been waiting so far for 45 minutes.            
                My partner is with HSBC and has been for about 6 years, he has a personal, business and savings account. We have been trying to get in touch with them to set up a joint account for about 3 weeks now!! Cannot get through on the phone and when we do get through after about a 30 min wait, they tell him that he isn't answering his security questions correctly.. so now he is blocked out!! I went into a HSBC bank to set up a appointment... no appointments for 3 weeks. At the same time we got a new key fob as my partners had broke! They said "just take this home and ring this number to set it up, they will give you a new code". Yeah right, only if they answer the god dam phone. Last time I phoned them we finally got through after 30 mins and the Indian lady on the line continued to say "I cannot hear you, please speak to me else I will be forced to disconnect the call" At this point we are screaming down the phone saying hello... She once again said this and we were disconnected! I honestly don't have the patience to try and call them again. We are moving all of his accounts over to Halifax.. who in comparison answered the phone within about 3 minutes and we spoke to a lovely man based in England who set a appointment up for us within 5 minutes. HSBC you are a total joke and disgrace!!!! We have now got to go through the hassle of moving 3 accounts elsewhere, but the hassle will be worth it in the end to not have to deal with such a joke of a bank which is HSBC. I warn everyone to NEVER EVER bank with them!!!!!            
                Waiting on hold for 45 mins now - Very disappointed. I have been with Midland bank/HSBC for thirty years. Thinking its about time to move my overdraft elsewhere.            
                No matter when you phone morning noon or night you can never get through it is always at least 25 minutes. It is crazy I think it's time to move banks. There is no loyalty schemes and for business accounts it's even worse            
                I have been back in the UK for several months now, and because of full-time work I've not been able to get into a branch. This means that in order to change my banking address I have to phone them. This is an experience akin to serious, self-inflicted injury. "We are experiencing high call volumes, customers can be waiting up to 25 minutes for their call to be answered"25 minutes? Last time I phoned HSBC, I'd just gone to bed with my wife. By the time the call was answered I was a proud father of one. I'm currently on the phone now, and my left ear is bleeding; the 'music' on the line is hideous - it's a cross between Elton John and liturgical, Christian music... I HATE MY LIFE            
                20 minutes to ask why they had not sent a credit card up to 4 days before expiry date. Agent had screen technical issues while on lineTold not ordered. Will take several days to send.Several days without a card. Why was it not ordered automatically? No answer.Absolutely hopeless as I know the major card systems have this built in (TSYS or First Data).  Worse this happened the last time the issued the old card.Get i some decent management and sort it out !!!!!            
                Tried to get through via phone to fix my account - they claim a 20 minute wait but seems more - going to switch banks            
                I have been banking with HSBC for 6 years and the service is getting worse every day. You can literally do nothing over internet banking and asks to try doing it over the phone. It takes at least 45 minutes go get hold of an agent if you are lucky and also costs you a fortune. I have already left HSBC as I couldn`t stand this any longer. The worst banking experience ever!!!!            
                I have banked with HSBC for over twenty years and am genuinely shocked at the lack of service. Whenever you require anything outside of logging on through the website it always takes an age to get through. The staff are no longer as professional with a clear computer says no 'little Britain' type attitude. I am now considering leaving the bank I am so fed up!            
                I called HSBC...  Well tried to get through to them to switch my secure key to another device so right now I cannot access Personal Online Banking. After calling for two days and waiting for more than 40 minutes I just gave up and left it. Luckily I'm also banking with another bank so whenever I get the chance, I'm going to transfer all my funds over as this is just ridiculous. Also I may be no longer banking with HSBC. ---THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER---.            
                I have been with HSBC for 20+ years and now I need to change who I bank with as I can never get to speak to them. I have been trying to contact them for 3 Days now as my son has got a job and needs to set up an account. I have finally got through after 3 days trying. They can set his account up over the phone but he needs to go to the branch to sign a form. This isn't a problem apart from there is no appointments till 3 months time!!!! I couldn't believe what I want hearing I've never known anything like this. I have gave my opinion over the phone regarding the issues with hold times and the last said they are aware and this is being worked on but they will have no customers left by the time the issue is fixed. I don't want to have to move banks but I feel this is the only option!!            
                I've tried contacting HSBC to reset up my secure key onto a new phone. It was my 4th time to try and speak to someone but being on hold for at least 30 minutes at a time I've given up. Honestly, why is no one answering the calls ? It is a disgrace. I am so annoyed as it is the 4th time I called, different time of day and it made no difference. It is disgusting. I have not been able to use online banking properly as I cannot reset it. It says to call such and such number, but how? No ones picking up. Sort it out HSBC. If I can give 0 stars I would have done.            
                Every time I call, the minimum I have to wait is 45 minutes. Last week I needed to call them as I had to make a telephone banking payment urgently as was on the phone ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES!!!!!It never used to be this bad- a couple of years ago their telephone banking service used to be quite good! Now, the longer I bank with them, the longer it takes for them to answer the phone. I don't understand why they don't just employ more people to take calls as, judging from the amount of people complaining on here, there is obviously not enough staff. I won't be banking with them for much longer...            
                The only connection I have with HSBC is my mortgage which I have held for 6 years. I am purchasing a new vehicle and had received an email from HSBC offering personal loans at a very attractive rate so I decided to apply online on Sunday. When I completed the application form and pressed submit I was concerned to note that I didn't get any reference number or details when I would receive an acknowledgment. After waiting 2 days I phoned Customer Services and because I couldn't remember " memorable word or place " from my Mortgage account ( never used it in 6 years) I was told I was locked out and would either have to wait 5 days for letter to be sent to reregister security details or call into a branch ( nearest one is 2 hrs away) After spending a frustrating 2 hours speaking to several staff I got nowhere and they said they would send my Complaint to a Manager who would be in touch. No one has contacted me and meantime there is nothing they can do to access my application for a loan!! I then phoned M& S Bank where my previous loan was with and within 10 minutes my loan was approved ans this morning loan documents were received in the post . HSBC take note - that is how professional Banks deal with their customers!! I will never deal with HSBC again!!            
                It's a shame Midland Bank were consumed by HSBC when I was a kid, and my early account automatically transferred to this amoral behemoth. I have probably waited in phone queues for whole months of my life, dealing with their ineptitudes and lack of care. I have been booked into interviews at the bank itself, but no one is any the wiser of anything at HSBC, no one can help you you are just a spec in their massive sea of amoral dealings. HSBC is the choice of drug cartels, money launders, international criminals... it is a an evil, awful thing.            
                I called the phone banking hotline and was put on hold for literally I mean literally 45 minutes before I could talk to a staff. The staff services were alright as they managed to fix my problems but I am complaining now because of the 45 minute wait!!! I would give a -5 stars if it was available! Seriously, if you are put on hold, be prepared to wait for at least 45 minutes. Overall, HSBC is one of the worst banks in terms of customer services.            
                Appalling service,re-mortgage went into local branch so I could avoid any telephone calls with call centre. As previous time it was nightmare .I  spent 3 hours in total sorting mortgage in branch,only to find I still had to contact call centre to release funds . Spent over hour trying to get through on friday!! No message on phone to say how many were queuing or expected time to wait or cost of call.  I was assured my funds would be available on Monday and guess what it wasn't. What a surprise!! I            
                same gripe as others... i hung up after waiting 45 minutes... and tried few days later same thing. came here on journey to find out why they are not answering. does anyone get through at the moment? a few stars because historically they have been A1 in other aspects.            
                Clearly not enough staff to take the calls. Holding for over half an hour to get through to someone that is no help whatsoever!!! Shocking!!!!            
                Dreadful service. Time to transfer to another bank who can provide better service. On average 45 mins to answer a call...            
                I've been waiting half an hour. I'm not sure if the call is included in my phone contract. And, for some unknown reason, they only have one song in their call waiting queue. Which seems to be played through walkie-talkies the quality is so bad.SO AWFUL.            
                Internet locked out3 calls lasting 65 minutes at different times yesterday and two calls lasting 24 minutes today.listen to numerous delaying explanations and then hang on.  No one ever answers the phone and one track music is mind bending.Only locked out of internet banking and need it reset but cannot get through.            
                three times on the phone 3 times kept waiting 'no answer..wasting my time am getting in contact with the ombubsman to find out what is going on and lodge a complaint...Unacceptable and inapropriate for a bank to treat customers this way...Will be filing for compensation for my time...            
                Banked with HSBC both personally and business for 14 years.  Decided to move our business account to Yorkshire Bank (great bank btw!) and our problems started.  We were interrogated repeatedly about paying money from our new YB business account into our HSBC personal account (our wages!).  Eventually, they sent us a letter saying they were going to close our personal account/credit card/saving account - without giving us any reason at all except that they can do this under their company T&C's!  We were gobsmacked, we have legitimate Ltd company, pay our taxes all completely above board and we are treated like criminals.Avoid like the plague!            
                Online banking is a nightmare that constantly spits errors out. It is complex to use, near impossible to login via apps. You must memorize 3 passwords/codes for online and phone. If you muddle them up, you get locked out. It will take a week to restore. Or perhaps you get an error page for no reason and then your entire online account is dead and noone will fix it. Call centres are crackly Indian voices who dont have a care about you and never call back ever. Phone banking is a minimum 45 min wait. Branches close at 5pm with no weekend clerks at the desks. Branch staff are jaded, unhappy skeleton crew and poorly trained who can't get the simplest task right like reactivating ISAs. I even got sent a form with someone else's personal details on it.  Bank only takes action when after days of inaccessibility, you threaten them with the ombudsmen.  Result? No, they still haven't fixed the issue and the Indian call centre is laughing. 21 years a customer, now I am leaving.            
                I've been trying to contact both the internet banking helpdesk and normal customer service number for 2 hours now.  Cannot get to speak to anyone and it's approaching 10pm so no doubt I'll just be cut off!!            
                After 35 minutes of wait I hanged down. Unacceptable standards.            
                I have banked with Midland / HSBC since 1990, and I am reluctantly closing all my accounts, and I will be moving my mortgage. Complete indifference to me, and lack of any personal service has driven me to make this decision. Anyone that has a long term bank account will know that moving bank accounts is a BIG upheaval, and not taken lightly due to all the standing commitments. I am moving to Lloyds, and changed my mortgage DD over from my HSBC account to Lloyds, only then to receive a letter from HSBC telling me I had missed a mortgage payment, and offered advice on managing debt, despite me having significant savings in my account, and having paid off significant lump sums of my mortgage this year. I also tried to decrease my overdraft on my account, and increase on our joint account - no, they cant do this, as a credit risk, despite seeing 26 years of  my financial history. I then applied for an HSBC, and was given Â£8k credit immediately - go figure that one !?To try to call takes up to 25-45 minutes to get through - shocking !!So far so good with Lloyds - you can call the branch, or you are connected to a UK call centre within 1 minutes.HSBC - I was very proud to bank with you - what has happened ?Goodbye !!            
                HSBC wrote to me and told me I need to ring them to set up joint account holder internet banking. I have tried to ring again and again. No one answers. I have rung every evening all week and have given up each time after waiting about 45 minutes each time. Absolutely disgusted. Am going to close all accounts and move to another bank, the final straw! DO NOT BANK WITH HSBC.            
                Tried to call HSBC twice now and both times been on the phone for more than an hour!! What kind of a joke is this. Feeling frustrated!!! I will be changing banks asap!            
                Absolutely AWFUL, TERRIBLE and the least user friendly and most annoying online banking and app!!! There are 100 different passwords and security codes to remember every time you want to make a simple transaction, and if you get one wrong (or most of the time even if you get it right!!!) you just get locked out automatically and have to call a number to get it unlocked again. The stupidest online banking system and app... complete waste of time and ridiculously annoying! AVOID OPENING AN ACCOUNT WITH HSBC AT ALL COST. I CANNOT WAIT TO LEAVE.            
                Sadly the same tale as other reviews of a once good bank that now seems indifferent to its customers. my retirement income is more than twice the average wage and yet because I don't borrow money I have received a letter that down grades my status and service level and effectively invites me to leave. Well I will be delighted to oblige. Interesting in this age of multi channel banking they have failed to make a number of connections to my other activities, or my total disposable wealth, so I will also oblige them by ensuring three company accounts are moved as well            
                I just had my card swallowed by my local hsbc bank and looking online for help just recommended to phone hsbc (if it wasn't Sunday I would have gone inside the bank). Waited nearly an hour, there is no queueing system to let you know roughly how long it could be. When I finally got through to someone after going through multiple questions I had the wrong department - I needed lost or stolen department, I could have saved some time if the automatic message you listen to mentioned that! The next guy did organise cancelling my swallowed debit card and said a new one would be sent in 7-10 days. But what I'm really annoyed with is I never found out why my card got eaten and instead they wanted to know if I wanted any other services from hsbc.....no thanks!            
                Had to call them 3 times in last 6 weeks each time over hour on hold I've changed banks shortly be closing HSBC account            
                I'm sure you guys will answer the call one day.            
                Would you like to speak to someone from their customer service team ? Forget it, you're better off changing banks and by the time all the paperwork is done you would still be on hold to speak to someone at HSBC.Joke, shambles...            
                Had to open an executors account to deal with a will. All the staff are always very friendly and try to deal with issues. Unfortunately, their approach is to email a colleague and for them to call you back. On seven occasions with various issues I failed to receive a single call back. Eventually went into branch, very helpful but unsuccessful. Someone had put a block on the account, despite HSBC sending out cheque books and a letter telling me the account was open and giving me a warm welcome and assuring me I would receive excellent service. Strangely, bank staff can only access the executors department using the same system the public use. It was warming to see that he had as much success as me! When he did get through only the person that put the block on could remove it. Go elsewhere, you won't regret it.            
                I'm with two other banks (coop and barclays) and this is the worst bank I have ever used! There is a catch 22 situation when you want to set up online banking and I've now been for 30 minutes in the queue on the phone! With an appaling wait music (quality wise) and no warning whatsoever. Do not use this bank! I wish I had seen the ratings on here before I signed up with them.            
                Hi I had a broken secure key so was not able to get onto my account to pay a bill. I went into my branch and got a new one. They said I had to call customer service to activate it. 1 week later after many calls of over 15 min (I can not wait any longer) I still have not got in touch with them. Disgusted with the telephone customer service. impressed with the local branch, lets give them more authority.            
                Absolutely pathetic service. Almost impossible to get through on the phone at any time of the day, and the banks shut so early you can't go after work. Will be changing bank ASAP.            
                Card was swallowed by an ATM today and I waited for 30 mins for someone to pick up so I can report it stolen. Even when someone picked up, he was extremely rude! Absolutely appalling. Definitely changing banks!!!            
                Honestly, waiting to get hold of customer service is painful. I've waited a colossal 1hour 40 minutes until I finally got through to "Shrupta", and even then when I asked for help/advise I was put on hold again, then put through to the wrong department. These guys must be sponsored by Disney because this really is Mickey Mouse.            
                The online banking app is glitchy, they expect you to remember roughly 50 intricate passwords, and they rarely answer the phone line in under 20 minutes!! USELESS and that's why I am leaving!!            
                Waited more that 30 minutes, just to get through Customer Services and still no answer, gave up due to frustration! BULLCRAP!!!            
                Recently applied for a loan to replace my car that through no fault of my own had been written off.  (traumatic enough times).  Having banked with HSBC since the days of being Midland Bank I've 14 years under my belt and have never defaulted on payment of any product or even made a late payment to my credit card and paid my previous loan back 12 months early.  I was made to feel by my American advisor that HSBC felt my finances where wholly out of control,  I had already borrowed to much and quick quick better get it back before he runs for the hills!  We all have life's emergencies  and no one wants to borrow but sometimes it's just one of those things,  I have always conducted my account well and my 'needs'  where not considered at all, customers are real living people! My mini Hitler announced that I was in too deep (in so many words)  and she wanted to review my finances immediately then and there despite my request not to at this time then telling me she could support my loan but it'd have to clear 3k off my over draft and oh she was bringing my credit card limit down too. (thanks so how do I eat?).  It was never considered that I have circumstances and a life style that means I have these facilities to ensure there is always a safety net. Oh but on the up side (and very pleased with herself) if I can pull 3k out of mid air she will let me keep a 1k over draft and give me the loan at double the Internet rate.  And when I'd met her demands I would just walk myself into a branch because she told me too and provide more documents to prove I'd paid back the 3k. Basically to be crude it was f off till you paid your over draft down you won't be buying a car anytime soon sir.  Thank HSBC but I really don't think my treatment was from the 'listening bank',  more like the 'put up and shut up bank'.  HSBC!  I'm not a criminal,  I'm a respectable hard working family man and my dignity took a considerable side swipe from you for trying ultimately to access a product that makes you money!            
                I live in Scotland and there's not a branch near me. In the past, calling the help line would probably mean 20 mins waiting time and that's acceptable to me, but recently, it has been impossible to get through to someone, waiting for well over an hour and getting nowhere. Most people are like me, hanging up after 40-60 mins, simply because we all have our lives to get back to, other things, better things to do. What if it's an emergency? HSBC come on, get your act together...            
                I received a text from HSBC to explain that I needed to contact the Fraud Helpline immediately. The matter seemed urgent but after waiting to be put through for over half an hour I decided to hang up. I did not want to waste any more time. How can an 'urgent' matter take so long to be addressed? This is awful customer service. Surely a company of this size can afford to increase the amount of people working in the call centres.            
                Been on hold for an hour now. What is the point. Moving away immediately when they finally answer            
                Just had excellent customer service from Steve Kwiatkowski at the Brighton branch in arranging my mortgage. He managed to agree it within half an hour of me leaving the premises (subject to sign-off from branch manager) and a quick meeting a week later finalised everything. Mortgage brokers had warned me off HSBC, saying they were slow to arrange things, but I've just had the opposite experience. They also offer by far the best rates at the moment - I got 1.99% fixed for 5 years!! Brendon Perold also very friendly and helpful in the branch :-)            
                Have been trying to contact the bank for two days, first day waited for 1 hour, then 40 minutes, today have been holding for over 1 hour now. Seems that their telephones are now unmanned and that is shocking!            
                You would of thought the financial sector of all places would have some spare change to throw at customer service. Clearly someone at the top is taking that money and buying a yacht            
                The whole phone support system serves no purpose except to pretend it exists. I wait for 40 minutes to speak to someone, and I am still waiting. Customers wouldn't need to call if it wasn't somewhat urgent to them, and yet the bank clearly cannot care less.            
                I chose HSBC when I was 16 because I thought they were the 'global, local bank'. Now that I'm abroad and want to speak to them (about a credit card I am paying off which I don't have access to on online bank so I have no idea what the balance is) they're asking me to wait at least 25 mins. Multiple times given up and once got through after an hour to no apology for the wait and someone who didn't understand what I was saying over a crackled line. Time for a change. How do they get away with such customer service??            
                Suggest ringing other help desks at other banks and picking the fastest to answer !!            
                This bank has been going downhill with customer service, coming from a call centre background i know exactly what goes on there.There are unemployed people who deserve work as they earn their money by working, and there are those who are employed but they dont put the work in.If you have a problem, change banks. The telephone numbers provided have you on hold for hours.Today ive been on hold for a total of 1hour each call (ive called three times waiting 35mins and then being spoken to, currently my issue is to request a new pin, something THAT TAKES 5MINUTES and im on hold for 13minutes now... (5th time i called back) they tell you to wait 15minutes, yet you're on hold for an hour. You call back and they say 15minutes, yet you're on hold for an hour again, ive been experiencing this from 1pm today and the time is now 7:18pm.What a joke.            
                Having been an HSBC customer for the last 22 years (both business & personal),I have seen a very disturbing decline in the 'hands on' customer service.To elaborate,I used to have a one to one meeting with a business manager in the early days,which then became a telephone call from the business centre in Leicester - purely an annual thing to chat about how things were going,& 'how can we help?'.Nowadays,HSBC are merely content with remaining silent,whilst fleecing the small business account holder for the privilege of handling cheques etc.I daren't pay any cash into my business account,as HSBC think it's time to don period outfit & act out scenes from Scrooge...Why can't I deposit my hard earned cash without penalty,when,on a Monday morning,you can go to a variety of HSBC branches in certain towns,only to be delayed by individuals depositing bags of coins from their weekend's business dealings - & HSBC NEVER question the fact that these individuals are actually paying money into their accounts from regular business transactions.A double whammy there....not only do I have to wait an inordinate amount of time to deposit my hard earned,but,when I finally get to the counter,I'm expected to tolerate a financial spanking for the privilege......Oh.....I forgot to mention.....HSBC have just closed the branch I normally use,& so I now have to go into another town for any branch transactions!I've actually gone off at a slight tangent here,as the main reason for leaving such negative comments about HSBC is due to them having just refused my application for a personal loan on 'affordability' grounds - this being despite the fact that I quire recently deposited more than 3 1/2 times the amount required into my account,and more than fulfilling the minimum annual income criteria.For this rejection,I now have a mark on my credit rating,due to some complete (or,most likely,incomplete...) incompetent HSBC employee not taking the time to check my application against my accounts history.WELL DONE HSBC - YOU'VE JUST CREATED UNNECESSARY AGGRAVATION FOR ANOTHER LOYAL CUSTOMER....My next task shortly is to imminently contact another bank with regard to handling my accounts effective immediately            
                I was waiting a bit more of the personal of HSBC customer services when I had a issue with my credit card last week, but I tried to call many times and no one ever respond. (wasn't weekend) .            
                I reached my HSBC credit card limit, fair enough, they declined. So I transferred the money via online banking, Hoping to continue to use the card on vacation. They declined again, 26 hrs later, I called them and they said it takes 2 working days to transfer the money, What that really means, is they'll steal my money for 2 days, while they use it to gamble on the stock market. meanwhile, they'll decline my usage of my own money. that's called theft, no other bank has done this to me. I'm appalled and I'm going to drop HSBC and get another bank.            
                Try getting through to HSBC telephone customer service and you could be waiting a L O N G T I M E ! after 28 minutes i gave up. And sadly this is not the first time,what with closing branches or cutting back on staff this bank has become in my opinion useless.            
                Absolutely disgusted with the waiting time to speak to an advisor! Being advised 25 minute wait then still waiting 46 mins later gave up and ended the call only rang as my replacement card was ordered over 3 weeks ago and still haven't received it!            
                I am very much appalled by HSBC's recent derisking measures that caused much chaos to ordinary long-time account holders such as myself. The fact that a monstrous size global bank like HSBC with countless executives on fat payrolls couldn't prevent the eventuality of your sad state of business today ($1.9b fine etc.) tells us very much what kind of bank you are.I was utterly furious at first with the closure of my accounts in US, Malaysia, Australia and now Singapore. Thinking what the hell is going on but I was never given any access to allow at least a decent conversation how we can absolve a possible anomaly flagged by your multi-million non-personal software and database. You simply took an easier way out rather than reaching out as opposed to what 'Relationship' would have defined. At least a defendant gets to be tried before the judge with an opportunity to present supporting evidence; whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty?I was hoping to be audited by the bank, or at least a chance of inquiry on any supposed questionable transaction but after reading about the greed of HSBC Swiss Private Bank, money laundering for Sinaloa Cartel and business conducted with links to terrorism, I am now uncertain if I want to be related with a great evil such as this organization? Perhaps, I could use the tactic of one renowned blogger of the banking industry (Brett King) who after rounds of speaking to a hopeless call centre based in Calcutta, got his accounts reinstated.But this is the state of the world we're living in right now, isn't it? Innocent consumers get the consequences when evil, greedy empires screw up. The rich and money launderers will ultimately find another 'HSBC', business will be as usual, however our lives will be in a total mess because you choose not to reach out or have been paid too much to do so. At least, the irony is I still get to keep my HSBC housing loan despite the fact that the bank 'regrettably' and desperately trying to end this relationship.I challenge you to reestablish communication, that I may transparently present my supporting documents for EACH and EVERY transaction. The honor of a man's name is at stake, and it will be extremely disgraceful for HSBC if such simple request cannot be granted.            
                I banked with HSBC for over 30 years Theye were Midland Bank then , Who used the slogan " The Listening Bank"/  HSBC have turned this into the "Falls on deaf ears bank" The customer service is abysmal, There is always a queue in the Branch, Don't even bother to try getting in touch by phone they don't appear to employ any staff to answer it.Internet banking is a nightmare. It;s quicker to walk down to the cash point.Perhaps when they said they were considering moving out of the UK the government should have helped them pack.  Totally useless, obviously only retain the customers they have because people are reluctant to change banksYou can send this review to HSBC they don;t don't take any notice anyway, and that's assuming they even bother to read it            
                Been on the phone for 1hr now and they haven't picked up yet. I also can't get onto my online account... Help!            
                I was with HSBC for over 25 years. I left them and moved to another bank about 1.5 years ago as I found them really unhelpful and completely different to the bank I used to deal with. I still have a HSBC loan account. I can see the balance on the app, but can't access my details online. I have tried to phone customer services to change my address details several times as I have recently moved and just keep being held in a queue each time for over 30 mins without speaking to anyone before I eventually give up. What has happened to HSBC? I'd never bank with them again. Absolutely appalling!            
                Every time I have been in contact with the HSBC bank I have been treated like a criminal although I'm an Advanced account customer. Unacceptable behaviour, rude and unprofessional staff. And have been told that this is HSBC and I can contact other banks they may be softer and easier to do with????I will do so and leave this bank.            
                try Al rayyan bank online, thats what I say. More ethical use of investor funds and savings than any high street bank can offer.  But even bigger than that is the fact that they dont do "fractional reserve banking" - an evil in itself            
                Cannot believe how they can expected people to wait listing to music for 40 minutes calling from overseas, and still not being able to speak with anyone from the bank, have been with HSBC since 1985 what happened to this bank!!!!!            
                Tried to set up an account with HSBC. Had to wait for forty minutes in store to be seen only to be told to make an appointment for the next week. After that I went in and gave my details. Weeks pass and no reply from the bank. Go in and complain and two weeks later I'm given a card. At this point I assume my account has been set up but have no details to confirm it and only have the card. Try to set up the online banking but no reply for weeks after I sent all the details. Complain again about the lack of correspondence and my situation. Unsurprisingly, no information is sent to me. Try to activate my card, but no response again. Given up because I can't trust them with my money after all of this.            
                Banked with HSBC for over 2 decades. Their customer service is now beyond a joke. Minimum waiting time of 25 minutes every time you call, terrible quality phone line and staff that don't speak English well enough to understand the issues. Thank goodness we've only been trying to close an account.            
                Awful; the staff are terrible.            
                Absolutely disgraceful.  Have tried to get through for 3 days.  Each time I gave up after 30mins on hold. My issue cannot be resolved in branch so I need internet banking.  I think change banks is the answer.            
                Was on hold for 40 minutes - tried calling back on a different number. 20 minutes later, still on hold. No sign of changing. I've never known a bank service to be so bad.            
                WE had issues with our business internet banking account and it took us 30min in the waiting-queue, only to then being transferred 5(!!!) times between departments until we found out that our 3 partners need to fly into HK to meet the HSBC staff in person for a couple of signatures. The joke is that we all have met last week in HK with HSBC to discuss other topics and nobody ever informed us about another open issue. In general I recommend everyone, either personal or business-related, to refrain from opening an accout with this bank - only hassles and every process is twice as long and complicated than with any other bank out there - just ridicolous            
                I have been a customer for years and it was normally quite straight forward and quick to get through to speak to an advisor but the last few weeks I have had to call I have noticed a dramatic increase in call waiting times!!! What on earth has happened? Less staff? More complaints or a strategic plan to keep us on hold so long that customers give up? Whatever it is, it needs to be addressed ASAP.Thankfully HSBC is not my main account holder, I was almost talked into upgrading my account last week in store but I certainly wont after this.Its also so tedious to get bank statements. Cant print it online, cant get it printed in store- you have to call (on hold for an hr) or go in store to order them. After waiting for them for days, they sent sent me the complete wrong statement dates so I now have to go through the same rigmarole again.  So so frustrated.GET THIS SORTED HSBC            
                Waiting times are completely unacceptable sort this out HSBC.            
                Absolutely disgusting. Kept on hold for over an hour. Disgraceful....they should be ashamed of them selfs            
                25 minutes is not acceptable, especially if you are on a PAYG mobile.And that's an "estimated 25 minutes", god knows how long it would take if I hadn't given up after 10 minutes, and then 20 minutes.Even when you do get through you will get cut off after they pass you around each department.            
                Noone should bank with this establishment - locked out of my online and mobile banking all the time so I cannot actually access my account and the number they tell you to ring puts you on hold for 30 mins plus + it's ridiculous - when they eventually pick up they have no idea what they're on about! they have dreadful systems and it took me 3 weeks to make an appointment to even open the account I'm leaving !            
                Have been trying to ensure our statements go to the correct address. No one contacts us when they say they will, they say 5 working days, when their timeframe passes they say they will be in touch "shortly". Days pass so we complain...guess what? Asked to wait 8 WEEKS!! But someone in some team will be in touch "shortly"....still waiting.Asked a simple question, can we send another letter to reiterate what we already told you...why would this be so difficult to answer?Been customers over 25 years...treated dismally.            
                Obviously some features aren't available online so I needed to use telephone banking to get a bit of help with these. Still waiting for over 90 minutes on hold now. What an absolute joke, still haven't spoken to an agent, and have heard that awful tune about 50 times. Keep me any longer and Ill probably go insane. Hurry up!            
                Personal and business banking are both a joke. Personal is a joke for getting through on the phone. Business website is always down. I accidentally transferred some money into the wrong savings account (I have a preferential regular saver account (good interest rate but you can't save more than Â£250 a month into it) and a typical savings account. I put funds into the preferential account in error. But it's not allowed in there - so I immediately called to get it transferred out (as you cannot transfer money out of that account online). They transferred it back with the message of "if it happens again we will have to close the savings account" Wow!A simple mistake that takes 5 seconds to rectify and you threaten to close my savings account! And I, my dears, will close all business and personal account and take my money elsewhere!Update: 3 months on; I closed my account and making over Â£50 a month in interest and cash back with another bank. Amazing!            
                We went to hsbc to find out about mortgages. We had a mortgage agreed in principle and had an offer accepted on a house. When we went to finalise the details they said they needed at least 3 years of accounts. I'm self employed and only have 1.5. They should have told us this at the initial meeting! The staff are completely incompetent and we have now wasted months of our time when this should have been mentioned way earlier. Caused all manner of headaches for us. Don't ever use hsbc! Complete waste of space!            
                When people asking what bank you bank with, if you answer hsbc your automatically not there friend anymore. What a rubbish bank, hire some English people will you in your phone call department, instead of getting my problem solved I end up playing a game of trial and error for them to try and guess what my problem is!!!!! Absloite useless the lot of ya            
                I had a mortgage loan with HSBC and paid it off in 2007 -NINE years ago. I did not request a discharge because I was not aware of the need. However, New York State requires a discharge be sent to me and to the clerk in the county the mortgage is held in. HSBC failed. The same thing happened with my current bank - NBT. I need those discharges now. NBT took care of it in three days with an apology. HSBC said they needled 30 days and even then failed to do it. This is a dishonest company and incompetent to boot.. Use any other bank but not HSBC            
                I rarely use my account (like once a year). I lived in the UK for two years and I keep it now to cash birthday gifts from British relatives. I live in Canada. I wanted to check my balance to thank someone for a gift they deposited, amount unknown. 1. I don't have internet banking. To get a password, one must call the bank. 2. I go to HSBC in Toronto. They have NO relationship to HSBC UK. Can do absolutely nothing for me; it's like they're unrelated. 3. I go home and try HSBC from skype. I wait on hold for 55 min. Hang up. 4. I go into the brach to use their phone so that the call is free. I wait 75 minutes. In that time I make a guess at what my phone password is-- wrong guess. 5. Someone picks up they need to ask me some security questions. Question 1: NameQuestion 2: What other products do you have with usQuestion 3: What did you purchase on June 15 value 97pence. Question 3 I got wrong. I never use this card. Must have been some kind of surcharge for something. My account is immediately blocked. 6. Wait on hold for 20 minutes while she gets her supervisor. I say ask me some new security questions--  she can't. It's total lock down. 7. She can mail me a new PIN to my UK mailing address (my parents in law). Will be there in 5-10 business days. * when I lived in the UK I had every possible problem with HSBC> The staff are poorly trained, the rules make no sense and there's no coordination between branches, HQ. The MINUTE I get access to my account I'm moving to Santander. I will tell everyone I know to stay away from HSBC with a ten foot pole.            
                In hindsight I should have avoided the HSBC like the plague. I'd read the reviews and thought surely they cant be that bad, after all they are a high street bank. Unfortunately they are! BE WARNED!!!!Very very slow in processing information. Call center a joke as they cannot tell you anything merely advise you that they will email the underwriter and get them to call you back which never happens. They ask for information that has already been supplied on numerous occasions. Totally unacceptable communications. 1 month to advise you that they cannot process your mortgage application is ridiculous.Don't be drawn in by there rates they really aren't worth the hassle.            
                Shocked that DAS LEGAL CARE who they employ are then worst legal help they are condescending self righteous and idiots            
                The (simple) telephone number 03457 404 404 number for telephone banking, constantly informs you that due to high call volumes the service is currently unavailable.  I wonder !....  Is the service unavailable, or is it, as the call is answered, just a way to charge a premium number and then not provide the information. Good way for this crowd to make even more money, cant just be me, can it ! A terrible service. HCBC sort it please, its 2016, additional lines if overcrowded cant be that hard to sort out.            
                They claim want to help you but instead treat you with utmost disrespect and drive you to near suicide ! Their treatment of customers is horrendous and one department contradicts the other.    I have fallen into arrears on my mortgage and have a  large over draft. The mortgage team says i HAVE to pay my mortgage by direct debit. The over draft team says they are cancelling all direct debits and standing orders on my overdraft bank account. ?? For 2 years i have been past from pillar to post and i have now raised a complaint with the ombudsman over the treatment i have received from this bank.  The financial stress they put people who have got into trouble is not good . They do not want to help and all they seem bothered about is themselves. Horrendous Bank.            
                Me and my father were at HSBC Sutton branch this morning 09.03.16 trying to open an account for him.Politely girl named Simona explained us everything we need, and made us appointment,the previous day .On 09.03.16 at 9.30a.m another lady Adeeha .... said that is not true and we do not have the documents they need.I just have no explanation ...is that unprofessional service .... or they do not  know what they need or ...just want to lose my time .Anyway I am so disappointed.            
                This is absolutely the worst bank on this earth customers waiting at least 20 minute on phone to be attended, it shut down all branches in Manchester for some sceptical reason (for sure) only one branch left in city centre where there is no way you can access with car, unexpected charges every month, had to switch to another bank            
                There is no customer service at Hsbc business banking in Hong Kong. There is a radio playing bad music and an illiterate moron picking up the phone from time to time to tell you he can't do anything, please call back at another time. Just a polite way to tell you to go f..k yourself. Oh, BTW my business account has been blocked now for three month for no reason. No problem it is HSBC. Or maybe there is because I run a publishing company specialized in business news for Asean countries.            
                I was informed at the start of the call waiting times were upto 15mins then went on hold for a full hour before getting poor help from people who didn't really grasp what the problem was and would only tell me what they couldn't do. (Which I wasn't asking them to do anyway) eventually speaking to a manager she accidentally told me what I needed to know. I say accidentally because she was still explaining why they couldn't help me do what I didn't want them to... What a mess... But they were polite.            
                Appaling lack of service and arrogance from HSBC in the UK. My father banked with them for most of his life until he died last year. Mistakenly, I persuaded my mother to close her account with Barclays and consolidate at HSBC, where bill payments etc. were already set-up. Trying to get Third Party authority is a nightmare compounded by the fact it is not possible to contact anyone directly and in 3 months the waiting time has never been less than 25 minutes! Don't get me going on their letters, opaque and totally unhelpful; HSBC is still firmly in the 19th century and deserves its inevitable fate at the hands of challenger banks.            
                Unbelievable, it takes 3 months to open a bank account.Trying to call HSBC Lewisham millions times but no one answers.            
                Over 1hr on the phone before answer!            
                My experiences at an HSBC branch have been stellar! Short waits. Friendly, helpful and competent staff.My online and mobile app experience however have been tedious. The online banking system and app are both seriously dated and clunky, missing many handy features. There is a South African bank, FNB, that has mastered the online and mobile app functionality and experience. In their case, its clean, easy to navigate and it's feature rich. I'd say FNB's user experience is at least 10 years ahead of that of HSBC.In todays society, online should be the primary focus. Once this comes up to speed, i will happily rate HSBC 5 stars            
                I waited about an hour  to speak to them but wasn't able to  get through so I got fed up and the cut the line.  It would be very helpful if they  could arrange a call back time.            
                On hold for 1 hour and then I got hung up on.            
                I have current account, savings, mortgage, credit card, loan and insurance with HSBC.Recently after trying to arrange a mortgage for a new property (which was approved) they are completely dragging their feet and their mortgage managers have no idea as to what they are doing!I have asked for a call back from a manager regarding my complaint and feel as though the mortgage manager is just delaying even further.HSBC's online and branch system are not aligned so I had to completely re-do the mortgage application... the mortgage was approved by the underwriters and then a day later they asked for further statements (which they said at the time of our face to face appointment a week before that they didn't need them)I just can't fathom how diabolical their customer service is. I was warned about HSBC being extremely slow by several reputable estate agencies and Conveyancers... stupid me for thinking I'd receive a better service!PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS. IT REALLY IS NOT WORTH THE STRESS!            
                My wife died in early November and a few days later I contacted John Lewis partnership card customer services which is run by HSBC to close the account as I didn't want an open account that I had no means of monitoring for any fraudulent transactions. I was told that as there was a zero balance this would be done and that no further information would be required and I could cut up the credit card which I did. I later received a statement dated 19th November which showed the zero balance. So far so good. I had to cancel my wife's car insurance by Esure which was done and the refund of Â£217.38 had to be sent to the original card holder. I explained the situation and Esure said that they expected that the refund to be sent back to them and they would then forward on to me so that I could complete the probate on my wife estate. Esure never did receive the refund back, so after contacting them in January they advised me to contact the Credit card company. I was then advised by credit card customer services that although the account was closed, transactions could still be applied.  I was rather surprised at this revelation having worked in the banking industry for over 40 years. I also asked why there was no attempt to send me a statement for my wife's account since the 19th November or contact me and did not get any satisfactory answer.I was then asked to send in the death certificate and write a letter which I duly did explaining the situation and asking them to transfer the credit balance to my John Lewis partnership card. A month later there was still no refund in my account, so I contacted them again and was told that I had to complete a Proof of Identity form which they had sent  me and I would get in the next 5 - 7 days (Still not received). Why I needed to do this as I had an account with them could not be explained. At this time I had to resort to threatening them to be reported to the Financial Ombudsman, The Sunday Papers and Martin Lewis. I was then passed to a supervisor (Shamila) who proved to be very helpful and moved heaven and earth to get this refund into my account today 19th February 2016 (over 3 months after the problem first arose). What concerns me is:(a) This is not an unusual situation - people die every day(b) HSBC, acting on behalf of John Lewis, don't seem to be bothered about applying transactions to a closed account to prevent fraudulent activity(c) There was a complete breakdown in HSBC processing of such transactions. The statements stopped coming (which is ok when the account is closed) but not when transactions have been applied and there was no attempt to contact me by any other means.(d) If I hadn't chased the refund it would still be there today sitting on the account doing nothing. Having worked in the banking industry I could recognise the situation but other people would not necessarily be as aware(e) I have made countless telephone calls and written letters to obtain this refund without any compensation being made.(f) If there had been a debit balance on the account then i would be incurring interest at 18%. I have had no compensation for HSBC holding on to my money for 3 months.(g) I have also had to delay completion of the probate on my wife's estate with all the additional solicitors costs and the added stress at a difficult time.I will be copying this letter to the Finance Director of John Lewis Partnership and I would suggest to him that they change their credit card processing company as it is not fit for purpose and harms the reputation of John Lewis.I look forward to hearing from you. RegardsRod Pyke            
                I joined hsbc and asked for the easy direct debit change so the transfer went smoothly. On the phone it was straight forward, I waited 2 weeks and nothing had been done so I rang and they had no record of me?, I then was told oh yes they have and something went wrong so I will have to wait another 2 weeks. 2 weeks later the bank was set up but it was the basic bank and none of my direct debits had been transfered.  I then rang and I was told I would have to wait another 2 weeks for my direct debits to be transfered, that's 6 weeks because of unprofessional idiots on the other end of the phone. Naturally I went with another bank and my new bank took 5 working days to set up. Hsbc is the worst bank I have had to deal with.            
                Charging customers Â£10.50 per quarter just to hold a customer portfolio.It's not as if you are doing anything with it whilst holding the shares and you do change a fee for our selling/buying of shares.Just unadulterated GREED.Hang your heads in SHAME.            
                Horrible. Easy things. But take a long time to do. Wait for hours Everytime for the customer service to Serve us. Time is money. You are taking our moneyyyy.            
                HSBC UK is the worst financial institution that I have dealt with accross the globe.One would be better off without a bank account than one with HSBC UK.The staff at the HSBC branch in Haslemere are also particulary rude.            
                Just because our turnover has gone down, they decided not provide us with a relationship manager anymore -the one who says "computer says nooo". They are now answering our enquiries by telephone banking team, who even more useless, they cannot even answer a basic question about the credit card we pay monthly. So, please don't believe in those fancy adverts on TV and other media about HSBC, my personal experience is, they are total rubbish.            
                Did online application just before xmas 2015, having stupidly ignored the bad reviews.  2 phone calls later and today (4th Feb 2016) & I'm told that because its gone on so long, the application is no longer on their system.  ??????? I sent back signed documents 4 weeks ago, only after having made the 1st phone call to find out what on earth was happening.  So much for a 7 day "switch" - maybe that's true but nowhere does it say it might take 2 months to actually get the a/c opened in the first place!!!  Given its one of the largest banks in the country I am SHOCKED that how a simple process can turn into a nightmare.            
                Spent 45 minutes at 150 A minute calling from Malaysia,  recorded message saying they had a high call volume. Not enough staff answering the phones more like, terrible,            
                I've literally had the hardest time of my life opening an account just for a small period of time that I'll be in the UK, and once I made it, the internet banking comes up with error after error just in the process of setting it up. I am tired and furious. Now the card stopped working for no reason, and they will not return or answer any calls.            
                My secure key has failed and I have to ring to be sent a new one. However, no-one is answering when I ring up the call centre. Hopeless!!!            
                I thought I'd try HSBC for my business, but I wished I'd listened to my inner voice that said "Natwest have been excellent for your personal accoun, why not stick with them". Instead I gave HSBC a try and it has been a complete nightmare right from the star. Trying to open the account was a nightmare, dealing with buffoons who kept losing my application. The mobile app is atrocious and light years away from the superb Natwest one. Online banking is so unreliable it is costing us business (the website seems to be failing and offering apologies on a daily basis). Can't wait to move everything to Natwest and never go near HSBC again.            
                In the last few weeks HSBC Premier have refused me a small mortgage because income from rental property " is not a secure income" This despite the fact that our 5 rental properties are paid for in full and all let. Today we received a letter informing us that credit card interest rates are increasing by 50% !  We don't use our credit card often and always pay it off immediately if we do, but what a way to treat your customers. Good riddance HSBC.            
                We are trying to fix it as quickly as possible- but don't know when that will be!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            
                I had an HSBC account from the age of 18 to 26.  There was noting wrong with the accounts themselves and they were always run in very good order so I personally had no problems as I followed the T and C's.  I find a lot of issues come down to T and C breaches or not keeping the account in good order.In my pot, I had e-Saver, Flexible Saver, Current Account, and an ISA account.  With all these accounts I was getting Â£10 to Â£11 a month tops even though I had substantial cash savings.  I moved my accounts to another provider (Santander) and my savings on my first month after the switch went to Â£30 and have been climbing since.Tl;DR - If you just want a simple current no frills account and you keep within limits and T and C's their current account is for you.  If you have savings then other banks are for you.            
                Thirty minutes on hold to reach an advisor, at my expense (a regular occurrence). No apologies whilst waiting or indication of how long you will have to wait. Really poor customer service, and led to me closing my account.            
                20 minutes no pick up... the worlds best bank>? come on employ more cheap philipionos would you stay on the phone line for 20 minutes costing me Â£3.50,, get a grip!            
                I intially wanted to open a new account with HSBC and go through Switch Guaratee to transfer from my old, Santander account. I assumed this would be straight forward. How wrong I was!After filling in the online application form I waited 1 month before my card arrived in the post. I couldn't use it yes as I didn't have a PIN or a Secure Key to access online banking. After 2 more weeks waiting, I called HSBC and was assured my PIN would arrive 3 days after my card (it had already been 14 days). In the meantime, I tried to access online banking, the app was full of bugs and kept crashing so I could only use a desktop version. Without a Secure Key, I couldn't do anything. After many hours on the phone to their Indian call centre this was finally sorted.PIN finally arrived and I called the number on HSBC to start the switching process. The website says this is 'hassle-free, quick, easy, blah blah'. After a 30 minute phone call I was told it couldn't be done over the phone and I'd have to go to the branch. I went to the branch next day and was told to'take a seat'. Sat waiting 15 mins before asking 'how much longer?' I was told another 15 minutes. The appointment was an hour so I didn't have time and left.  I've now decided no to switch and just keep the account with 1p in it. I formally complained to HSBC and the follow up to my complaint was just a phone call saying 'apologies'.I thought I was just unlucky but after reading the reviews on here it's obvious the bank is terrible. I'll never use them again. Ever.            
                I have moved from France to UK in 2010 and the worst mistake I could probably ever made was to open an account with HSBC UK.Branches are closing down and if by any chance you get to find one they can't help and always send you to the customer services.Once you call the customer services you spend more time waiting for your call to be answered than dealing with the issue.This week has been so far one of the worst!Online banking was shut down which meant i could nt make a transfer that was urgent and was stuck in a Sainsbury with a big amount of grocery shopping at the till wich was quite embarasssing.I called HSBC to make the transfer but obviously the line was "experiencing a lot of phone calls" ... I ended calling a friend who kindly transfered me the amount of money needed.Then, today I tried to make an international payment for my student loan in France....a real disaster!The details from the previous one were gone, and no one was able to guide me and tell me whether or not the transfer has been made and received. Here is what the lady on the phone said " As you made it online, we cannot access those information"So I still dont know what happened to the transfer i made last month. The money is gone but my bank in France said it didnt come through.Every year I tell myself I am leaving HSBC but this year it is really happening.No bank is perfect and I dont expect them to be . Having a brother working himself in a global bank in Paris I know that it is not always the bank's fault.But there is A MINIMUM I do expect from my bank:- Friendly and EFFICIENT customer services- The ability to help and provide supportThat is not too much asking?            
                hsbc leaves the costumers out by system being down, I'm nearly 10 years with them and with getting worst and worst every day.I wanted to make a international transfer, for someone in need and get hsbc message 'we are sorry it seems theres a system problem' problem ???? problem are getting the child I'm trying to help she's having leukaemia mieloide this is the real problem not your stupid system.            
                I called in to my local HSBC 4 miles away as i needed to set up a standing order and as entering the branch was approached by a member of their staff, a smarmy chap " how can i help" he ask's, well two things firstly i need to arrange a standing order: no problem he interrupt to tell me, so now i say secondly say i think i may have some PPI owing. The change in tone and the way he spoke was disgusting, bringing me down like i was something he had trod in. Anyway i knew the lady in a fashion and i told her about my experience with her colleague so she helped me out beyond the call of her duty and i told her that even if i got only ten pounds back i would buy her some flowers  The result got three grand back! sent the lady the flowers and i don't know why but the smarmy guy is not so cocky( maybe it got back) so not all is bad.  But on another level my wife needed an account hasn't got a current account and has been left a considerable amount of inheritance. They got us to sit through a sales pitch to invest the money for an hour and half and then said we would have to make an appointment as they were shutting the branch and we still had no account open for the wife, even when we went back they didn't want her to open an account in her name they wanted it joint as it seemed it would be in their interest ( sorry but cant remember the reason) but iwas firm in the fact i didn't want anything to do with her money and with many two's and fro's by the assistant to the manager the account was finally opened. even though this is not really bad experience compared to others on this site i am now looking for other bank companies to do my banking with as they have upset over other issues over the years and been with them nearly 35 years. Loyalty counts for nothing nowaday's .            
                I have banked with HSBC since 1997.  Over the first few years it was fine but now it continues to provide little service and that service that they do provide is terrible.  I recently had a VUSA dispute with a company that HSBC was dealing with and they said if I did not respond within 7 days they would take the disputed amount back into the company s bank account that I had the dispute with.  I received the letter I needed to respond to on the same day that they said in the letter that I needed to respond by. I had to ring and wait on hold for a very very long time and then got a 5 working day extension, mailed them a 9 page document with cover letter and email references and they still refunded the online company that treated me disgustingly. I am looking into moving banks as soon s possible.  I am absolutely furious with them and their terrible service.  If you are thinking about moving to HSBC then DO NOT. They are terrible at costumer service, are constantly changing their terms and conditions and furthermore are continuously closing their branches.  That is no surprise considering just how terrible they are.  Do yourself a favour and go to a different bank or building society.            
                Tried to phone the credit card customer service, no one answered the phone for over 30 mins, waste of my time. The worst banking telephone service.            
                To be a banking institution all over the world almost, it has the worst customer service and banking that I have ever experienced.  The hold time is the worst...30 - 45 minutes! The call center is loud and it gives indication that there is no personal touch. When ask to speak to a supervisor it was a 20 min wait, then they hung up. I called back and the lady admitted that she was in the Philippines. Disappointing. After a another 10 min hold, she transferred me to an online supervisor, who admitted she was in the USA. she gave me the details  needed in reference to why my account was messed up and advised me to go to a branch because they needed to see identification that they could not verify online. It took me almost an hour to get that answer. Another thing, there are two different numbers, one rings in the US the other rigs out of the US Country. HSBC need to shut it's doors down. I've dealt with them in the past and I thought maybe they would had improved...nope, they got worse. But, I must say that the ladies speak nice, just don't seem to know much about nothing when it come HSBC...that is unless I am speaking with someone who actually work for HSBC and not contracted out in a call center.            
                my experience with HSBC sheffield  was the worst bank experience in the UK . I'm a new foreign professional in the UK , and like i need to open a bank account i go there .They accept all my paper and they said that the account will be open in two week , but i'm still waiting until now !! 7 weeks , and they don't open it . I go today to another bank in the same street  and they open me an account the same day . They have a huge delay in their system and they waste my time . I don't recommend.cheers            
                I have a business account which for 12 years has always been in Credit. We also have a CREDIT card (getting a Debit card has proved impossible to date).The card was at li's limit half way through the month so I visited our local branch to pay off the balance. "Can't be done until the end of the month" says the cashier and when I said I just wanted to transfer the amount owed from my normal account I was still told it can't be done. "I am sure it can be done" I say at which point the cashier asks me if I am calling her a liar! Great, so I return to my office and refund my own card with our card terminal...Job done !!!!!The issue of the card continues as apparently we seem to have two cards though only one in reality. We want the one with the higher limit. Visit branch and am told that I have to make an appointment to see a business managaer in Oxford. Didcot is closer but folly booked for 3 months. I go to Oxford (20 miles) see the Managaer and he tells me he will arrange it. Well that was 6 months ago and you guessed it...nothing has happened. You can't ring him of course.Lastly I asked for a Debit card (see no point in paying the worlds worst bank interest to borrow my own money) and so on the web-site I manage to get a 'phone  number that doesn't play music interminably and sepak to a nice young man (who I can barely understand) who promises me he will sends an application form in the post.....10 days ago and nothing happens.By far and away the worst Bank I know and I am 75 so I  have known a few......            
                I recently went to hsbc for an agreement in principal on a mortgage. I had recently gone self employed/sub contract and realised having no tax returns etc for the year would be an issue, but with hsbc being my current lender I thought they could help.At the meeting I was told yes, they could, after speaking to underwriters they explained to me it would be classed as an 'exceptional case' and the funds would be able to be lent, after the usual checks etc.On this information I sold my own property, and had an offer excepted on an other.I returned to the bank, no more than 2/3 months after the original meeting.Upon arrival I was told no, it would be impossible.I was essentially descriminateted against for being self employed I felt, and even with a good sized deposit, good credit history, no missed payments ever etc it would be no.I asked as to why I hadn't been contacted about this, and got given a pathetic excuse of they had written my number down wrong. As I explained to them, I hold a mortgage , savings, bank cards, credit cards everything with them, and they never have no trouble contacting me about those or when there trying to sell me one of there "wonderful" offers.It isn't my own issue with them, I had also split from an ex partner 12 months ago, and had sorted the mortgage then to buy her out. It took forever to sort, and the solicitors hsbc use are hopeless. It took myself in the end to be constantly phoning between those and my ex partner (who I didn't speak to no longer) to get it sorted. I heard they had sent documents to the wrong address and name and hadn't contacted her at all, when they said they had.Upon completion, the fees were much higher than hsbc had 'estimated' and also had been took via direct debit, and added to my new mortgage total!! It took 3 attempts to make the clown I spoke to on the phone from the "mortgage team" to understand what I was saying, and had to resort back to basic math to do it.There answer? Solicitors fault. Solicitors answer? Banks fault. I was made to feel like I was the idiot who had made the mistake, and that I was wrong.My final issue is with a joint account from that relationship, I asked for it to be closed down, as we both no longer used it."Yes sir, no problem, we can transfer all funds and debits today" That they did....but one. The account went overdrawn, and also it wasn't shut down, it's still open now. There answer? We contacted the other party and couldn't get hold of them.So what HSBC? Your just going to leave it at that until a miracle happens? I was also told due to the account being overdrawn it had affected my "behaviour score" for the month, that's not my fault!! That's the banks own incompetent staff not being able to sort something properly!All in all I'm disgusted with hsbc and there service, since numerous brokers, and advisors have told me that there mortgage service is known for it. They make empty open promises that they can help, you go away, come back and they slam the door in your face.I for one will be selling my property still as planned, and once completed will be removing all my deposit,savings, etc to a bank/lender who do actually care about there customers.As I was told by one broker , "there that big a bank, you and your bit, Is nothing to them, they don't care" .            
                HSBC app cannot add new recipient.This is the last straw on me to write this review. HSBC is always refreshing the concept of "impotent"-no money transfer when I am abroad, no any kind of transactions when token is not handy, website always not responding...... I wish it a peaceful shut down            
                This is the worst experience then in other countries around the world I have ( includes third world countries). HSBC Central London - never ever!I went to branch to open new bank account (just REGULAR f-ing bank account!!!) I brought all required documents with me, guy told me he donÂ´t know the company, so he send me to different branch (maybe there would be someone who does).I went there, very nice guy made me bank account. So nice, that he put my address wrongly - even when it was written in front of him on paper from my employer. I found it after 2 weeks endless waiting for the card. I came to branch - told what happened, they told me to call customer service from their phone. So I did. I understand every third word in their Â´very well maintainedÂ´ phone, but nothing solved. So I went different branch, where was possible to do it with human being, amazing. My card arrived after 2-3 days, I went to online banking to active it, didnÂ´t pass through mobile password because they blocked my phone banking. So I tried different way to log in, blocked my online banking and give me a sign to call customer service. I called customer service, after 20 minutes waiting, operator told me to go to branch with id. I went to branch with id, they checked, told me itÂ´s okay (indian headshake) and you can call customer service and make reset. I went home, called customer service, they told me itÂ´s blocked and go to branch with your id. Instead of taking care about my stuff as a new person in London, I have to spend my time running around HSBC branches, because.... Honestly, I donÂ´t know why !!!!!            
                I have been trying to contact HSBC over the past week.  I don't have a local branch that opens Saturday and work long days so am unable to get out to a branch during the day therefore my only alternative is to use the Customer Service Centre.  I had the unfortunate need to contact HSBC last week.  After 3 days of trying to get through - to be told the wait time was between 15 and 6 mins I decided to take the bull by the horns and phone one evening; I was told by their automated voice that the wait was over 6 mins.  39 minutes later I was still holding and hadn't spoken to anyone.    The service is appalling.  If you are going to close branches at least have the call centre set up properly and manned by staff who speak good English.  I eventually left a message through my internet banking log-in page and have yet to get a response - that was over a week ago.            
                My work load is busy and I use the bank daily, but HSBC have a Rapport Security pop up and ask if you want to install it, then disconnect you and you have to log back in and start all your work again.  They have told me on more than one accession that they are working on a fix, but at the moment it would be quicker to change accounts to another bank, and cant be any worst service.They charge high enough charges, get their pay and bonuses, but their service to us as a customer is as bad as I have experienced anywhere.            
                As a new "premier" customer, HSBC gave me a new credit card and said that I'd get $250 cash back or $400 in airline tickets if I spend more than $2,500 in the first three months. I spent the required amount, but they refuse to give me the bonus (in cash or airline ticket).  I spent my $2,500 during the three months after I had RECEIVED the card in the mail, but they say that I needed to have spent the $2,500 during the three months that began immediately after I signed up for the card at the HSBC branch.  [It took ten days for the card to arrive to me in the mail.  How did they expect me to start spending when I hadn't received the card yet?]  This is a small matter, but it makes me distrust anything/everything that HSBC says.  I will soon be taking all of my money out of my HSBC bank accounts, and I'll never have another banking relationship with them again.  HSBC made a big deal when I started with them that I have a "premier relationship" and a dedicated Premier Relationship Manager at the branch.  This person couldn't intervene in the dispute and get it resolved.  Therefore, I suggest that the "premier relationship" is a bunch of garbage.  My advice to anybody that reads this:  STAY  AWAY  FROM  HSBC,  AND  DON'T  BELIEVE  ANY  OFFERS  OR  COME-ONS  THEY  PROPOSE.            
                It's not that important Iv been locked out of my online banking which I use everyday to keep control of my money. After trying to get back into my online account the last step was to ring the customer service line who will lets say help me. After three days of constant ringing and waiting for hours for someone to answer I still can't get through to anyone. Is everyone off sick? I just want to get on my online banking but who knew it would be so difficult.            
                HSBC Has to be one of the most opportunistic and unprofessional Global bank ever dealt with. Funds transiting their platforms constantly get held hostage and get milked for interest while their second or 3rd party clients frantically follow-up and complain to get it released. They, like cowards, wait until the last possible second of pressure mounting from their clients to release these payments. They will eventually lose loads of corporate and retail clients for their greedy mischief.            
                Went to the branch on Churchill way, Cardiff. Was served by the 'senior' customer service officer lisa halai which provided me with a very unpleasant and unwelcoming experience.            
                HSBC On-Line Fiasco, Failures, Debacle, Shambles. Mirrors their appalling 'Customer service' & HUGE Phone waiting Wows! Is their ever a time when they aren't 'experiencing long call waiting times' its continual 8am through 8PM everyday they are open !?I have been a HSBC Bank account holder for some while and have seen 'customer service' worsen almost monthly in various ways.1. Terrible and worsening Call time waiting for someone to respond. 2. 'Customer service' which is now often more than not outside the UK and appalling. Deliberate indifference, complete lack of professional sincerity and professionalism!  3. Now Appalling On-line banking failures, whether one is trying to set up an overseas payment when their very OWN HSBC Bank HQ in another countries city fails to be recognised with their so called 'Bank locater' and even their corrected BIC and Swift code.  Or On-line website states System error / failure!  All after considerable time was wasted imputing all lengthy 'fields' information in detail! To Signing in and on-line time out and hard to visualise areas for Log-in  detail boxes to try to Send a secure on-line message where it fails with no matter how many times one spends attempting to complete the message while trying to exclude any and all absurd 'characters' it disallows and never explains what is the forbidden / disallowed 'characters' anywhere etc, etc! Literally Wasting hours in-vain only to Fail !  My latest Story  :-Sadly I had to complain about the on line service which said 'technical problems' and 'System Failure'  at several stages of lengthy form filling on-line. Because this HSBC On-line banking Failed over and over I had to go through to a HSBC call centre and transferred to and Indian Wire Transfer person at HSBC to make the wire Transfer after a considerable 45 plus minute wait.A simple and easy project one might of hoped ??? NOT with HSBC on-line Banking !!!More difficulties ensued all because I could not get on-line and complete the form myself!  Locator for their HSBC Bank failed, Even their BIC code was not recognised!  Their HSBC bank HQ in a Major city abroad address was not recognised! During all this anxiety and HSBC on-line bank failures and obscurities the website 'Timed Out' several times!More Huge time wasting, More Financial Losses, More Stress and anxiety All Completely Unnecessary because this HSBC bank can't have a sensible, Functioning Banking On-line website !!!Please don't get me started on their ridiculous constant advertising Popups that confuse and litter their Failed website !!!    Get a grip HSBC your System of Banking Has Failed and Continues to Fail !!!            
                Went in their branch and was greeted by a really rude employee. Wanted to open a bank account only because they offered a 60 pound voucher for amazon which I am not sure I will get now, it has been 5 weeks, 4 times going into the branch asking for help, calling customer service and get told there is nothing they can do, every time waiting period changed. First 7 days, then 3 weeks, then 8 weeks and I am still waiting... just to get any notification from them to get the honour of being their client... seriously how hard is it?            
                Clearly HSBC is Punishing its customers for being taken to task by the government bank watchdog etc!Relocating their 'tele banking' to India and the ridiculous waiting times we now have to suffer ALL the time!!! Anywhere from 35 to 45 Minutes before being very fortunate to get through ? Fortunate ? well with their Poorly trained 'Customer service' staff you are faced with ignorance, indifference, confusion and an attitude of Oh Well...not a quality expected from a international banking group is it!?The Refusal to take responsibility for Negative feedback as here and Complaints ! Rather ignoring them as if they don't matter !HSBC take a good look at the HUGE level of Complaints against you and take heed this does not look good and will effect all that you are concerned with, Profit Clearly not Your reputation and good standing in Banking industry which clearly You Do Not Have if reading all these countless Negative reviews against you here show! Also where do you get off with Condemning a customers Rights to give Negative Feedbacks and Complaints???   Surely any company should not only embrace them with a view to address these Deep Concerns but value those honest customers taking to give them! Not condemn and further consider it a black mark against those that do as your "Indian tele customer service' suggested to us !Terribly indeed! Please, if you as we have had reason to complain and get nowhere use the Financial Ombudsman as we do unlike HSBC its a Freephone number and your not kept waiting 45 minutes !            
                Whatever happened to HSBC 'Customer service' waiting time and 'service' appalling!I called not fitting the points of reference with the recorded message and my call was with general enquiries "Tele banking" therefore at 7:31 pm and it wasn't until 45 minutes later I actually had a human answer!  Costing me dreadfully over securing a bank card and asking for another for account safety be sent out. With my complaint about the time having to wait the call cost was over 50 Minutes.  No resolution, No compensation was offered by HSBC at that time by a foreign (Indian tele banking) call hander and call centre. Later waiting again over 33 minutes only for the handler to suggest I had complained before about another issue ? So there you have it HSBC have a limit on making Complaints / Feedback on their worsening Customer 'service' !While I am typing this I am again waiting and its well over 30 Minute again and no sign of a HSBC representative! Not all things can be done on line etc one should be able with any professional company to make contact with a Company customer 'service' call handler in a decent time Not at HSBC! Confirmed the 'Telebanking' is out from India again the waiting time and call took again over 45 Minutes.The standard of Customer 'service' is profoundly appalling and very much worsening!No Desire for a respectful resolution was offered for "Service Failures" Not then and Not now!Therefore I Contacted the Financial Ombudsman and made my Complaint there !  HSBC CANNOT be trusted with 'Tele-banking' and any form of Customer 'Service' it has dramatically gone from worse to worse!Spoke to the "Indian Tele banking floor supervisor ASHUDOSH" who said they are dealing with my complaints and this is why they have not been resolved! The Flippancy, Arrogance and deliberate indifference  I received was utterly appalling and Nothing anyone should expect with a professional Banking organisation anywhere and as my Costs vastly increased using HSBC I urge anyone to Bank Elsewhere !!!            
                I have a business account with HSBC as it was offered as part of a package when get my limited company registered. It was just so hard and complicated to open a personal account for myself some years ago. Therefore, I wanted to avoid it in the first place as me and some of my friends had problems with HSBC regarding personal account. It was triggered by an international payment I made to an account in China, which was returned after two long weeks. I wouldn't want to imagine what the consequences might be if it were any urgent business. Anyway, due to the exchange rate changes etc. the 5K I transferred came back as 4.8K ish and I was still charged 17 pounds for the transaction fee. I wanted to speak to someone to get this sorted. But the following up was just uglier. I was first of all told by someone from the International payment team that I wouldn't be given any information over the phone 'cos I have to see my relationship manager at a branch. So I called the telephone banking to ask for an appointment, when I was told that this doesn't have to be at a branch and the IP team should helped me over the phone. As I insisted, I was given my branch number, Cardiff Queens Street, which I called to hear a recorded message. I left a message but nobody seemed to care and I had to call again, being told again, that it can be solved over the phone. What followed then was again those bunch of currency conversion or regulation thing stuff. Apparently, I was still not happy about it, so I was put on hold for "two senconds" to wait for someone else, while I googled and found this brilliant website to talk about it. Then I was put on hold again to be put through to someone, during which I finished all the complaint online. They are still not offering me a time for appointment yet. It's been a 34'53" phone call. Could any customer service be poorer? There really should have been a zero star rating!            
                Total lack of customer service when dealing with my recent mortgage application over the phone as i travel a lot with work. Rather than dealing with 1 person I was passed around the houses and I dealt with over 45 different staff, all giving me different information to the last.They cost me time and money by giving me wrong information on numerous occasions. If i was not so advanced with my mortgage application and in danger of losing my new property i would have cancelled the application and moved banks.I was also in the process of opening an ex-pat account and transferring my saving to HSBC but after the inept service i received from HSBC staff i decided to stay with lloyds and i would recommend people to avoid HSBC as they have no care for their customers and only care about taking your money!!            
                They make everything overly complicated, even for the most simple things such as checking your bank balance.  Poor customer service had to wait over 2 hours for someone to answer when phoning customer service            
                hsbc are excellent at suspending bank accounts, its just a shame to think that they have nothing better to do, they have lost us thousands of pounds in turnover, just over one simple customer dispute, its ridiculous, DO NOT BANK WITH HSBC FOR PERSONAL OR BUSINESS USE, STAY WELL CLEAR, OR YOU COULD BE A VICTIM OF FRAUD FROM HSBC.            
                My wife had a personal account with HSBC for 3 years.. She had borrowed a sum of money (Â£5K) from her cousin and this made HSBC suspicious about the transaction. We were asked to come into the branch and answer few questions which included disclosing information about our mortgage. Our mortgage is with another bank. Why would HSBC want to know about that! I think they are too nosy about your affairs and they suspect you are doing something illegal.. I have had other bank accounts which had a lot more balance than HSBC and I never had issues with it. I would stay away from HSBC as it is known to freeze customer's accounts should they suspect any unusual activity...            
                Trying to open bank account . It's almost impossible if you are not long time citizen. Do not recommend at all.            
                I have been an HSBC customer for many years. Contactless technology was released in 2010, whilst I was an HSBC customer. Finally, in 2012, HSBC signed on, releasing a statement around this that it would not be reissuing cards to now include contactless, it would gradually roll this feature out when customer cards were due for renewal. Based on this knowledge I sat back for another three years - meanwhile not enjoying the same benefit as my friends and family in other banks - waiting for my card to be renewed in October 2015.You can imagine my surprise and disdain, therefore, when my new card arrives in October 2015 - when contactless technology  is all but standard - to find my card is STILL without contactless.Whilst this frustrated me, I thought perhaps (unlike at most other banks) I had to opt in. So, I researched this, and found the policy at HSBC was actually that customers would need to OPT OUT of receiving contactless on their new cards. I had never done this. I definitely wanted it.So, I rang HSBC customer service, and the lady at the end of the phone had a look at my account. She told me that my account didn't QUALIFY for contactless. I receive a steady income of over Â£1800 a month into my bank account, and have never been in any overdraft debt. I puzzled with the lady therefore as to what more I needed to do to qualify.She was absolutely no use in this, simply telling me I didn't qualify, she didn't know what the rules were, but the "contactless verification review team" were in charge of evaluating my account. They would look at my account "at least once a year."Faced with the prospect of never qualifying for whatever obscene standards HSBC have for granting contactless - in an age where contactless is more standard than not - I plainly told the lady I would happily switch bank accounts. When the rate offered by HSBC is little incentive compared to competitors, perks (not that it should be!!) like contactless are what makes the difference.Backed into a corner the customer service lady FINALLY told me how I could get a contactless card - if I upgraded to an Advanced account (which apparently I DID qualify for?!). Frustrated, I accepted this offer, and she told me I would be contacted by my local branch within the next three days. A week later, no call. So I called customer service again to try to arrange an appointment. Again, I had to wait. Finally two weeks after my initial phone conversation with customer service I had a call to arrange an appointment.Once at my branch appointment - by this point pretty frustrated with the whole experience - the advisor I dealt with was most helpful. She in fact seemed shocked that I had been told I could only get contactless by upgrading to advance, but nonetheless here we were, and the process was completed. I was now on an Advanced account, of which one of the perks was contactless, and my new card was in the post.SO you can imagine my absolute frustration with HSBC and the whole shoddy system it operates, when my new Advanced card arrived, and.. can you guess.. WITHOUT contactless technology.I have rung customer service who assured me they would send out a new card immediately with the technology enabled this time, but WHY should it be this hard?When HSBC claims to be so customer friendly, firstly why should it be up to me to fix this, and secondly, why is the whole damn process so slow, unreliable, and clearly full of bumbling errors. I am very disappointed in the service provided, and if I'm honest the whole experience has been a complete joke. Almost two months after receiving my new card for Oct 2015 and here I am, still without the issue being resolved. The standard set here is pretty low.            
                The above employee went above and beyond last Sat 7th November. I truly appreciate his help and it ensured that the rest of the weekend and this week went smoothly! Thanks again Darren!            
                I had to do some international payments and while HSBC has this option online i said to give it a try it worked well first 2-3 transfers this year in april i tried again for Â£50 and they blocked the transfer for investigations wich took around 2 months,after spending hours on the phone several times they let the money go (of course because of the 2 months delay i had to pay penalties )then in september i did another transfer for Â£50 and it worked well now in October i tried Â£68 and they are investigating again and they are doing it for more then 3 weeks allready,all this transfers went to the same account for the same reason and my payment its beeing delayed again and i have to pay penalties again,they are treating me like i would be a criminal            
                For nearly two months, HSBC has asked me to go to and fro visiting the branch because they kept missing out my details. The bank requires so much of my details that some people don't even require to provide. The countless trips I've made to the branch were pointless. Unacceptable reasons were given and yet they kept telling me to wait for a week during every single visit. HSBC bank might have a good name and reputation to it but to my experience and I don't understand the reason to it. This bank just have a horrible management and service. I highly recommend the public to register their bank accounts under different bank other than HSBC to avoid having this same experience as I'm having at the moment. Beware of their unlimited excuses            
                I went to the branch on CORNER OF 36TH STREET 1350 BROADWAY. I went to this branch 3 times in the last 2 weeks. All I wanted was to open a  savings account. There was not 1 person in that branch that could give me assistance. They kept telling me to make a appointment and come to open an account. I told them I can not do that because I work till later and the bank will close by then. Each time neither of the representatives try to help me in any way or was enthusiastic about getting my business. A asian woman who has a Vice president title at that branch even said make a appointment and come back because she could not open it for me. How pathetic is that. I ended up leaving very discouraged the third time I went there and ended up opening a account at TD bank.            
                Stuck in the dark ages. Backwards systems and processes. Customer service reflects the way they treat their staff. The world would be a better place without HSBC.            
                lost debit card, completely unhelpful. tried to use telephone banking and blocked my account because of apparently giving them the wrong information twice. it definitely was not. then tried to use online banking using a new secure card key which required resetting some personal questions. couldn't verify myself without my debit card, meaning I will have no access to my account for the next week.            
                I've been an HSBC customer for almost 20 years. It used to be just fine, but in the last 18 months it has simply ceased working as a bank. Moreover, HSBC seem to invoke new policies almost every month, each of which make LOTS of work for you, the customer. Let's call this 3 hours per month trying to fix stuff that they implement under threat of lsing your account or being reported to the authorities - really nice customer service. Most of this is driven by HSBC pretending to be a 'good' bank in terms of tax avoidance, laundering etc - we've all seen the news and know the truth.I've decided to leave HSBC today. Why? Well, here are a few examples in the last few months. Ignore these at your peril:1) an online trader took my money for items that were never in stock, nor ever dispatched. No problem you say - credit card security etc. Not with HSBC. HSBC basically assume that you are lying and protects the trader until you prove different. I've walked this road, and it takes reams of paperwork, tons of phone calls and months of your time. Strike 1 for HSBC.2) Due to my moving between countries, and using a parental address as a care of address whilst finding a new house in the UK, I was erroneously identified by HSBC as tax evading in the US. This was a complete error on the part of HSBC as I've never lived, worked etc in the US. In HSBC-land, having a care of address in the UK makes you a US tax evaion suspect. Oh yes, this came with repeated written threats of being reported to HMRC and the IRS for tax evasion for, yes you're right, using a UK care of address for 3 months. I saidm ok go ahead, I've nothing to hide. The answer "oh sir, if only it were so simple, we'll just keep sending you letters until you do what we ask". Again, reams of paperwork to do, you are not allowed to post your documents to them (which was an issue for me as there are no local branches within 45 miles). When I'd proved i was a UK citizen, had no US connections etc, I thought that was the end of it, but no (see below). Strike 2 for HSBC3) As part of proving I am who I am, I had to show my UK driving licence. Due to my being named after my grandfather, I have an extra forename that I do not use. This forename has never been used for my entire life, nor is it used on any other part of my life, or cards/documents etc (except my birth certificate and driving licence). However even my driving licence has my proper shortened name (i.e. missing one never used forename) on it as per the signature, which is the same for my UK passport. DVLA, HMRC and UK passport agency have never had a problem with me not using this one forename. Neither, historically, have HSBC- I've used the same name for 18 years with them. However, today I received correspondence from them saying that HSBC had changed my name to a name I've never used, and which doesn't match my 3 HSBC bank cards, nor every piece of correspondence I'd previously had from HSBC.  After a 1.5 hour phone call, of which 30 mins was waiting to get through to a customer service adviser (about the norm for them - sigh) I was informed that no, I couldn't use my own name, and nor could I shorten it. Basically, I've been told that HSBC gets to choose what I'm called, even though they now have accredited me with a name that no-one at home, work or family knows me by. Similarly, my credit record will be screwed as I've suddenly changed names, and lost my true record. I could not get any HSBC staff - as I escalated through management - to qualify why I could not use the name i've used my whole life, nor why it was now a problem for HSBC. FYI, I used the same driving licence to open my HSBC account back in the day 18 years ago, and they never had a problem with my 'proper name' then or for the next 18 years. Lunacy!!Ultimately, all the above hoo haa is a nonsense. It is HSBC trying to create an illusion of tax compliance in the US. But creating all the above, for a UK national, with no record or and connection with the USA, and changing their names against the customer's wiill, is a bank gone wrong. I'll be shifting accounts to another bank asap. Madness!!! If I could give a zero rating I would, but its not possible!            
                How many local branches have you closed in the last 5 years? Surely can't be classed as 'local' anymore            
                I am an internationals student who arrived UK in Sept 2015. I need to wait for 3 weeks only able to make my appointment with HSBC bank. HOWEVER, the lady told me I need 9-10 weeks if I plan to open a bank account when I went to the appointment! I'm like r u kidding me, I' m only  applying a student account. It mean I only able to get my account maybe next year! Who will wait till 3 months to get an account when other bank able to provide me an account by 1 weeks times! Beside that, the lady ask me to get my parent's bank statement as I'm a self funded student. However, HSBC bank do not state they need this documents in their bank website. And when I go to make an appointment, the person just told me it will be sufficient with my bank introduction letter from university. But, it turn out it was not sufficient when i meet the lady. I decide to go to others bank  and i able to make my appointment within 1 weeks. I able to get my account num and code by the day I went for the appointment . However, the long waiting time in HSBC had made my life become suffer! As u know sometimes it can be hard to survive in UK without a card. I might even passed the due date for me to complete my student registration with university if I wait for the bank card to arrive.  This was my personal experience with HSBC! Anyone can still go for HSBC if they prefer it.            
                I chose HSBC for business account switch service based on the free banking period and availability of a branch in my town.  Had a very lucky escape as having endured shoddy service and inefficiency with the switch I found that I had to keep ringing up for progress on the switch and even had to visit a branch to present documents for an online procedure!  I cancelled the switch quickly realising that I was out of the frying pan and into the fire coming from Barclays.  At the same time as I initiated the business account switch I did a personal account switch with Santander which seemed much better so I will now switch the business account to them.  Stay well clear!            
                Account closed due to their new 'de-risking' of customer accounts. Because they were fined after being caught laundering money for drug cartels and terrorist organisations they have used a computer to look at certain criteria and then just close the account. I've been with them for over 10 years and I am now being treated like a criminal. That's somewhat ironic. Just because I am self employed and have irregular payments in and out of my account. Thank you HSBC for treating your customers like this.            
                Well been with them 4.5 years now and just done a product transfer , I reduced the term so had to go to underwriters. Took pay slips and savings account statements (Halifax)into branch were they were great 2 weeks later my mortgage is all complete no fees Â£250 cash back and they gave me a 2.48% 5 year fix (applied for 2.54) I'm really impressed with the advisor called a couple times a week with updates Well done HSBC            
                After trying to set up my student bank account online 3 times I didn't receive anything from them, so I went into my local branch where I was told it hasn't gone through. I then set it up in branch, and after 14 days without my card arriving (after I had been told it will arrive within 7 days) I had to go back into my local branch, where they told they haven't even sent off for my card yet. They then sent out a request for one in branch but by the time I was told it would arrive I will have already gone to university. They have been no help whatsoever and absolutely terrible in every way. I can't even get to my Â£60 Amazon voucher I was promised.            
                Opened a student current account on the 28th August provided all the necessary paperwork etc. Received a letter from bank two weeks later advising that the account was now dormant due to not being used for two years!!!!! (still confused as the account was just over two weeks old). I was on holiday so my mum phoned to advise them of their error. Unfortunately they were unable to speak to my mum (breach of security). When I came back from holiday I phoned but was advised to go into my branch.Next day I got the bus to my HSBC branch to discuss the error they had made and was advised I needed to make an appointment and come back the next day(at no point was it made clear when phoning or in any of their correspondence that an appointment should be made, in fact the letter I received said I should call into branch to resolve.I will now be Â£8.20 (bus fares) out of pocket and it dosen't look like my bank card will be arrive in time for me going off to uni. How difficult can it be to find someone to deal with a problem that they created and should be taking responsibility for. Very disappointed in the way they hide behind 'data protection act' I have a letter on the day I set up the account so should be a no brainer and simple to resolve. Customer service should be bending over backwards to help with this problem.            
                I called HSBC customer care on Monday to activate my Credit Card which I was not using since couple of months. They asked me to go the nearest branch So I went HSBC Adyar branch . I asked there for the manager. They made me wait for 45 minutes. After a long waiting the Manager over there Was Sandhya , who came and asked all unnecessary things and for which I had to cancel my card. I never had such a bad experience with any of the banks. Customer service is very bad over there. Manager does n't know how to deal with customers. They should have proper training program to deal with customers...            
                I have a lot of companies in HSBC.My annual salary is more than the mortgage I want from them.My employees get mortgage easily than me, because I own more than 10% of the company who is hiring me.But I didn't note this "1" for that, but for the way they talked to me.Mooving to Barclays next week ! See you HSBC.            
                If you are considering HSBC for any financial matter, don't consider it any further for the following reasons.- Complex internet banking procedures where you are continuously being asked to fill in documents and send this by mail (!) for approval. Yet, it takes around 5 documents before they even start to notice that you want to change. Yes, I am talking about printing a piece of paper, sign this, put this in an envelope and send it by mail to their office...- Unskilled professionals; they do not know what you are talking about when asking questions about anything related to banking. I believe I had some trainees on the line. These people should not be allowed to handle Premium customers at all- Despicable customer service: instructions they sent over to do your banking simply do not work. Don't answer your questions, and do not know what they are talking about- Ridiculous rates of exchange. Yet alone the bank fees....HSBC - for me, you are FIRED!            
                This Bank ruin Human life. They supporting criminals and leting normal bumans living on the street. They supporting criminalactivites!            
                The bank is behind in technology in comparison with Barclays or Lloyds, but once you figure it out its ok. Flawless international service though.No touch card yet - shame.            
                HSBC were a shambles from start to finish. We were advised they had the cheapest rates by our mortgage broker and would be really quick to process the mortgage and that we would find out if we passed a credit check within 48 hours. Two weeks later, we had sent all of our documents and then were told that we failed the credit check, so would have to start all over! Our mortgage broker also couldn't get hold of them for over a day to find out what was going on.A further three weeks on, and I have just got a call from a local branch asking for our documents! I had to tell her we got rejected. When I asked when they received the letter to ask for our documents she said it was two weeks ago!            
                This bank is not good value after 50 yrs. I have switched to santander. Hsbc I can't get through on the phone to complain their security check when using credit card online is so time wasting and says transaction has NOT gone through when it has i have had enough.            
                I'm an expat. I'm living and working  in Makati, Philippines.   Few days ago, I fill out form for opening  advanced bank account  in HSBC bank. I have quite good monthly income and I'm working   for well known company. HSBC manager proposed  to  deposit $100 000- I rejected proposition, since I don't have  such amount of free money at the moment.   After all- they refused  to open account for me.What  the ridiculous requirement- deposit 100 000$???            
                If I could give them zero stars I would.I have had an HSBC Advance account since 2008. I haven't moved away just wanting to avoid the hassle and the paperwork, but after having had nothing but terrible, shocking, awful, appalling customer service (if you can even call it that) for 7 years and even more bad service this morning it's finally time for me to leave them.HSBC Advance is supposed to be their "premium" account - what exactly is "premium" about it remains a mystery - zero added value in any way whatsoever.  Not a single time have HSBC helped me with any documents needed, staff in my issuing branch (HSBC Holborn in London) are completely useless, when you travel abroad (even within Europe) - no other banks recognise HSBC and cash withdrawals are almost impossible ("the world's local bank"?? not so much!) - the final straw for me, all I needed was a single stamp on a monthly statement but they wouldn't do it. Why? Just don't. No explanation, no alternative options, no constructive customer service, zero helpfulness.            
                Applied for a HSBC advance bank account, was told in branch there was a salary requirement of Â£1750 a month. On their website, newspaper advertisement, billboard, and their internal system it clearly states you have to pay in a minimum of Â£1750 a month from external sources. Spoke to 5 customer service reps on the phone and there is no salary requirement. Which is it?            
                I have finally decided to vote with my feet and penalise this awful bank.It has failed me umpteen times: Filton Branch in Bristol is diabolical; they are a law onto themselves with poor managers and customer care team.  The telephone banking customer service is even a disaster and you may almost talk to automated machines.  Finally they have been discriminating against Muslim account recipients by causing enormous hassle submitting to Muslim charitable accounts.   I have decided to part ways.  When are they leaving Great Britania?            
                Tried to open a HSBC advance account over the phone. Was on almost an hour, and was then told that I was rejected (but offered a less attractive account instead). I was told my credit history was fine but their âinternal weightingâ meant that I was rejected despite being able to satisfy all of their funding criteria. They were (apparently) not able to tell me exactly why I was rejected. I have many other similar accounts with other banks (including their sister bank First Direct) and have (1) never been put through such an extensive vetting process and (2) have never been declined. Santander, Nationwide, TSB and First Direct have all accepted me for their most generous current accounts, and with minimum fuss.HSBC have basically said Iâm not welcome. Perhaps itâs because they want  high earners (I am a student). But Iâll be sure to remember this when choosing where to bank in future years - I wonât be banking with them.            
                On-line banking is completely useless and chooses to constantly look me out and having to wait until office hours to call for help as there is no 24hr helpline. Completely useless bank Halifax or Barclays are a million times better            
                I'm a 'Premier' customer. Heaven help anyone else. I have been trying to make an urgent transfer for over 8 days. First hand delivered letter lost by bank. 2nd visit I'm assured payment will be made next day, with no charge. Check next day, money not taken. Phone up. Delay caused by querying why no charge!!! Get phonecall to verify details, but have now missed cut off time and cannot guarantee it will be made tomorrow. This is only the latest fiasco. Too many to detail. Have already been to new bank to open new accounts.            
                Account has been closed without notification, I have been unable to eat, pay any bills, feed the children. Literally unable to do anything. They have place a block on my account because I was due to switch banks. I can't believe how rubbish this bank is! Customer service at this bank is atrocious too.            
                I will be moving my account to a competitor They have closed down the branch near my house and only want to deal online.            
                Contacting this bank is next to impossible, several minutes navigating automatic menus, the system refuses to recognise the account numbers it demands, then more menus before being put on hold and then cut off without ever speaking to a human being. On one memorable occasion I tried to withdraw money from my own branch in person. The staff made me PHONE the bank FROM the bank before they would hand over any money. My photo I.D. driving licence and bank cards were not enough to prove my I.D. to them!            
                Where to start?Customer with The Midland Bank....over 20 years and HSCB has just become more and more problematic over the time.  Customer service is none existent, customer value is none existent and you are passed from pillar to post and department to department.There is no interaction anymore with the bank; you are seen as a number and not a customer.  They are more interested in how they can hinder you than work with you.  Nothing is smooth.Branch support is shocking with staff coming and going like agency staff, all of whom don't understand you as a customer or their own products.I've been miss sold, had cards blocked for no reason or fault of my own whilst in high credit and have suffered from internal mistakes due to different departments not talking or understanding what the other is doing.  Business level is equally as poor as personal level and internet banking.....well that could take pages in itself and should be dedicated its own chapter!  Errors, access blocks, new passwords, apps and codes are all poorly managed and very very frustrating.With Business banking you have no contacts to meet with and are directed to a general telephone number where the people on the other end don't know your business and are unable to make decisions.  You find that your time is constantly being wasted repeating yourself to someone different every time you need to discuss anything financial in regards to your business account.Once had a business bank manager, then a telephone bank manager, then a general number instead and dropped into the mix.  Last so called business manager at my branch kept me waiting for over an hour at which point I walked out!Don't get me wrong if you are a large premier customer then they will probably talk to you as you are paying them a fortune for their services.  There is no interest in the small business.Once in a blue moon I shouted very highly to all my friends and business associates that 'The Midland Bank'....'The Listening Bank'  was the very best bank in the world but HSBC today have destroyed all that and I now highly recommend that people avoid the bank if they want a smooth banking experience.  Especially if they are small business owners far too much Hassel. None UK call centres for personal banking making it really difficult for them to understand the purpose of the call, with UK call centres for Business banking but with people that can't really make decisions.Overall not a recommended bank even though it was people like me helping to build it through loyal support.  HSBC have no loyalty.Difficult to move after 20 years of banking but thatâs the option we are considering right now for our own interest.            
                I had a business account with HSBC for about 10 years. At the beginning they offered me everything to move my account from another bank and were very good. After that period of time they didn't want to know. They will offer you overdrafts and loans until you are at the point that they no longer want to help and then want their money back.There telephone customer support is terrible and you get pushed about between different departments. You can't even call the local branch and if you asked them to put you through, they would say that there was no answer. Very, very poor service. The best thing I have ever done was to leave them, if only I had done this sooner            
                They sent me from one branch to the next, from one call operator to the next infuriated me with their foolish formalities, left me waiting on the phone for hours on end failing dismally to provide a functional service.I give them 1 star for being polite about it!            
                I am a third year student in from England, currently on an internship in Paris. Since I am going to be in Paris for a year and I am going to be getting paid by my place of work in Paris, it was necessary for me to open a bank account in France. So, I went to my local HSBC account in England and asked if it was possible to open an account with them in France. They said that it was, so I set up an appointment 4 days later. Then, on the day of the appointment, HSBC called me to tell me that it was actually not possible to set up an account in France from England, and that I'd have to set it up when I got to France. So, when I got to France, I went to my local HSBC branch there to set up an account. They then told me that I could not set up an account with them unless I had an account with them in England. The staff in both branches were also very rude and arrogant and I so I would never recommend this bank to anyone!            
                Been with HSBC since 1999. Have all my accounts with them, including my business account. Also have a very small mortgage with them because we have made over payments every year to bring it down to virtually nothing.So been to my "local branch".......Not, local branch was closed during there "worlds local branch campaign".We got into the "free for all sales room".........and asked to speak to someone about mortgages.We only had to wait a few minutes after being told the mortgage adviser would be free.So I then proceeded to explain our situation and that we wanted to purchase another house & sell on. Told her we were happy to put down 10% based on what we wanted to borrow.First it turned out the women was not a mortgage adviser, then she left us while she went to speak to an adviser.When she came back said it would have to be a buy to let mortgage......hike in rates & that we would need to put down 30% & had we considered using equity in our current property.I have what is known as an "HSBC advanced account" where your supposed to get preferential rates and all the other garbage this sales machine claim you have access too. However she never even checked our account for our financial position or was even interested in anything other than the equity on our house.I responded with a thank you but no thanks.What a difference from when i first took out my mortgage with them back in 1999 when you could speak to someone who was interested in your circumstances & could assess your financial position.HSBC not a bank anymore.............and will be happily moving my business elsewhere.            
                Agree with a previous reviewer. Spent 7 weeks jumping through hoops having had mortgage in principle agreed with them for Â£20k more than we ended up needing. Spent 2 hours on phone with mortgage advisor had to wait weeks to be able to do the application, told they'd refer to underwriter but it was a formality and would be ok. After 6 weeks with the underwriter (and much pestering from their surveyor to pay fees and book the survey) they rejected it based on affordability, when we currently pay out more! Totally out of line what their mortgage advisor had said. Had 100% mortgage with them in the past. Husband has banked with them for 25 years, I've been with them for over 10 years. Disgraceful that they can get away with advertising rates, offering higher agreements in principle and advise the best way to approach it and then keep you hanging on so long before rejecting.            
                They can't be all bad can they?1) Opening a commercial account. Took 6 months and a trip from Brazil to New York = Unbelievable2) Call centre: Disjoint bunch of operators with an obnoxious security policy = infuritating3) Online banking. Pitiful website.4) iPhone App is still for iOS 6 in original size = cheap5) Online/app capabilities = minimal6) Available information = minimalHmm, perhaps there fees are low, not sure, but I wouldn't even call it bare-bone.            
                Banked with them for 16 years and applied for a mortgage !! Both myself and my husband have excellent credit rating with experian and have good jobs no missing payments etc... refused as had a loan to clear an overdraft 14 years ago (obviously paid back along time ago). Apparently they put markers on your account forever to enable them to treat you poorly. Changed banks. Just wished we would have known and could have changed earlier .            
                I regret to be with HSBC for the last 10 years. I had worse experience with HSBC when recently I tried to open business account. It wasted my precious time and increased my anxiety and stress as well. Actually I submitted application online after few days, I received a miss call and voice mail, to arrange appointment over the phone for further details. I made appointment twice, everytime I received miss calls once only, then voice mail the next appointment would be after 3 weeks. I sensed it was just neglected appointment as HSBC could call more than once or could give me direct number to ring back or could call me in local branch. When I called back to explain the operator of HSBC rushed to cancel my application rather to offer me a solution. It's really ridiculous. I am going to change all my 6 accounts from HSBC to different bank. Similarly all my family members ~ 50 decided so too. lesson for all HSBC customer.            
                Made an appointment with my local branch for 11th May to turn over application and paperwork for a new account. Was told that it would take 15 working days to go through. I called yesterday morning (2nd June) to check on the status of our account, and was put through to Ahmed who is dealing with our application. He said he hadn't even sent out the application yet.  He said he would process it that day, and he would let me know if more information was needed.Later that afternoon, Ahmed called back. It seems somewhere along the way HSBC lost one of our pay slips, and, what's worse, because they were very slow in processing our application, and we were now into the beginning of a new month, they would now need another month's payslip as evidence.  They did contact me when I emailed their customer service, but they defended their process, said that it would take a further 15 working days, and denied receiving the missing payslip, leaving me even more frustrated than before.            
                On a bank holiday weekend I tried to pay for transaction in a shop, but unfortunately the payment was decined, much to my confusion. I knew I had a healthy bank balance so there was something strange going on. I called HSBC the same day to find out what the issue was and I was told that my debit card (which was still valid until 2017) had been cancelled because I had failed to activate a new card, which I had no knowledge of. I found out that HSBC had actually upgraded my bank account to HSBC Advance without my permission and therefore sent out a new card to go with the upgrade. However, this was all done without my knowledge and I have never received a new card, so the activatition would never have occurred. As this was no fault of mine, I asked HSBC to reactive my current debit card, but they said that it was not possible and that I would have to wait up to 6 working days for a new one to arrive- not to my home, but to my local bank (More secure apparantly)! I've now been waiting a week with no way to withdraw cash or make payments in shops and can only get to my bank at the weekend, making my life very difficult! No words can describe how upset I am with HSBC - their only advice was to transfer money to the bank account of a friend or family member and get them to withdraw it for me!I've been with HSBC (since the Midland Bank days) and have never had too many issues, but because this issue has caused me a serious problem, plus, I don't think I can trust HSBC with my accounts anymore, I'm considering leaving.            
                We've had a mortgage with Hsbc for over 6 yrs. NEVER missed a payment and in fact overpaying every month. Remortgage this time around was a total nightmare. Spent hours on the phone with the advisor asking questions that would frustrate the most patient person. Jumped through hoops getting & submitting evidence they requested only for them to say they couldn't offer us the remortgage based on affordability when the truth of matter was the issue of being self employed. Booked another appointment to apply without extra burrowing but no one called. So left in limbo with the then current mortgage deal 1 week due to finish. God being good, we found no fee L&C mortgage brokers. And guess what, within 2 weeks, we have a new remortgage deal with Halifax burrowing exactly same amount Hsbc deemed unaffordable for us.Even more shocking was the discovery that Hsbc had undervalued our property by Â£24000 compared to Halifax!!!!!!!!!Also not surprising that they didn't bother to ask for feedback. Shows just how much they value their customers indeed.So really not worth the stress, I'd just avoid approaching HSBC altogether even if they were the last option.            
                With respect to mortgage advice service we received recently we spent hour(s) going through all the options with the advisor and the consultation seemed clear, however and I totally understand that its up to the underwriter in the end, but it seems that her advice was a million miles away from what the underwriter had stated with her figures and options for us with HSBC compared to what the advisor had presented us with.The consultation has been a waste of time in the first place, further it has been very slow pain staking communications to date and I cannot stress enough that I have lost all confidence with HSBC after many years of great satisfaction.The whole experience as scuppered us not to say the least, the rate(s) on offer and packages discussed have been totally misleading. I would in future question the experience the advisor has got to give advice in the first instance, if in doubt ask for a experienced mortgage advisor from the outset, I should of realised when my adviser had a sit in mentor watching over her and marking her advice, but hold on didn't the mentor realise anything was misleading? and who's monitoring the mentor to see if they are doing there job correctly????Anyway it took nearly 3 weeks of pain staking slow communication after many voice mails and emails with no responses for days or a week, to be given a totally different outcome no where near the advice we had been given.Surely just being trained in CeMap is not enough to be let lose on the general public. I mean anyone can do these courses for cheap as chips.            
                I have banked with HSBC since 2001, variously as a current account holder, savings account holder, Premier banking customer, mortgage customer, credit card and personal loan holder, and business bank account customer. I am also a previous Head Office employee of the bank.I am a consistently reliable and profit-making customer for the bank, being that I have a relatively large mortgage and a credit card. As a family, we have an income into six figures. However, our cash flow has recently been stretched as we now have a disabled son and we have had a lot of expenses in relation to his disability. We went to the bank for assistance, wanting to consolidate credit card debt into a personal loan so we could ring fence it, get a better APR, and pay it off in a managed fashion. Sensible personal financial management. Would they let us? No. I guess because we are more lucrative customers for them if we keep our debt on credit cards. Putting the customer first? I don't think so.I recently also applied to open a business bank account. I have previously held a business bank account with HSBC that was well managed, and only closed it as for a while I became a full time carer to my disabled son so put my business activities on hold. Now they are ramping up significantly, and I require a business bank account to manage the finances with due care and attention rather than having business income and spending swimming around in my joint personal account. Would they let me? No. Would they tell me why? No.Thanks for nothing HSBC, you absolute douchecanoes. I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. Some of the customer complaints that came via the press office when they had escalated beyond reason were quite astoundingly awful. This bank is too big, too cumbersome, gives no credence to customer's individual circumstances. It's a bank run by highly risk averse, protectionist computer systems for the good only of its shareholders and Board. Everyone else can go jump, as far as HSBC is concerned.            
                I had a current account with HSBC from when I was a child to now about 30 years. In July 2014 they decided to cancel my overdraft even though I wasn't anywhere near the limit but still at a negative balance. The gave me a 180 days to clear the remaining balance in which time I halved the amount due.  I begged and pleaded for them not to create a default on my credit file because I have had financial problems, but I have tried to solve them and improve my credit file. I wrote several letters to their customer relations but nobody could help me. They told me the situation was out of their hands! I always believe that something can be done to help (a code I follow in life) but HBSC don't have this community spirit. They cancelled my account and referred it to a debt collection agency. I have now a default on my credit file that will be there for six years and I am now experiencing issues getting credit for simple things like car insurance which was never an issue before. I have just paid off the outstanding balance today (22/04/2015) but I have been told it will take six - eight weeks for HSBC to get around to updating my credit file to show that it is settled. Hopefully people will read this and decide not to trust HSBC with there money. I am hard working person, I not looking for an easy ride in life. I do not deserve the damage this company has created to my financial records just because they had to follow procedure.            
                Tried to open a Second bank account to deal with house hold outgoings on a monthly basis. The online application process was easy enough and was accepted. I received a letter through asking to take proof of ID and proof of address into ANY branch. Promptly went in with these documents only to be told by some obnoxious assistant that they couldn't copy and send the documents as they were not a service branch or something. I pointed out that it clearly says on the letter take into ANY branch. Reluctantly it seemed he went away copied and sent the documents. I asked which branches of the bank it should be taken into - the closest one being around 8 miles away or further in the nearest city. I am fortunate to drive but if you were elderly, disabled etc do they really expect you to trek miles instead of using your closest local branch? I SPECIFICALLY asked the assistant if it would be a problem that my proof of address and ID had two separate addresses on. No of course not. Ok.Waited two weeks for another letter only for it to state that I needed to take in a form of ID with the same address as the proof of address letter. WHAT? USELESSTore up the letter, would never bother with them again. What a waste of nearly 4 weeks trying to complete the process.Despicable useless customer service in branch. Try another bank.            
                I have just spent nearly half an hour on the phone to HSBC central customer services trying to set up an appointment with my local branch. I explained I needed it this week but at the end of the most painful conversation ever I was offered next week! Why isn't it possible to just go into my branch and see someone and failing that why can't I just phone the branch direct to book an appointment. Awful service.            
                Do yourself a favor and don't use HSBC.  Worst customer service where people read from a script and aren't helpful at all.  They transfer you to India where they can't escalate your call, but will call you back in 2-3 business days...even if you have an emergency and need your money now.  It's just terrible.            
                I have just had a terrible experience.  On my way home from work needing food and petrol, I tried to pay for my shopping.  To my shock my debit card was declined.  The embarrassment along was awful.  I telephoned HSBC from the store, taking at last 30 mins in all, to be told that they have UPGRADED my account and sent me a new card.  So the card I was trying to use had been DEACTIVATED.  I explained that I did not ask for an upgrade, nor have I received a new card and therefore please REACTIVATE the card which is valid until 2017.  I was told this was not possible (not believable in this day age).  So I have no way of getting food, petrol or cash on a bank holiday weekend.  I am furious.  Logging onto my account, I can see that I have an 'activate new card' line on my account.....therefore HSBC can clearly see that I have not activated 'the new card'...but they have still deactivated my current card.  I am so angry that I am closing my bank accounts with immediate effect. Mari-Ann Park            
                After 17 years of happy banking, we had our first ever problem and HSBC have dealt with it badly.  Fraudsters impersonating us walked into a branch and, armed only with a fake driving licence (no debit card etc) they have been able to withdraw up to Â£25,000 from our joint account.  One time a branch in Kent phoned and asked if I was in the bank withdrawing money, I told them it was a fraud and they let the people walk out. Nobody at HSBC in a senior position takes charge.  It is all faceless.  They don't care what the effect is on you.  But they merrily hand out cash to fraudsters based on a driving licence only.  My local branch said they would not have allowed the withdrawals but two central London branches did.            
                I have been a HSBC customer for 0ver 20 years but have many experiences to tell that they're the worst.HSBC state free withdrawals abroad but when you use atms or debit card to pay food,petrol bills, charges are applied for currency conversion,transaction fee,atms fee.HSBC staff told me that this is VISA ,ATM charges but HSBC stated free withdrawals abroad!! I have had my visa card stopped whilst abroad and as soon as i arrived back in the UK reinstated automatically!HSBC refuse to pay visa debit cash back with excuses all the time,i had to take it further to the financial Ombudsman to get HSBC to pay but during a conversation with india call centre my account was blocked deliberately for refusing to talk further for over 30 minutes as they don't speak english well and want to learn from you,what audacity hsbc got,they should pay me for teaching them and wasting my time! Now i have had to travel 16 miles to the bank from my home!My wife transferred money abroad and because HSBC system couldn't show the bank code the money was returned minus hefty bank charges.I have only listed the most important faults with HSBC!!!!            
                You will be told to go to the corner and select an option on a phone, then you stand in the public area of the UK branch and speak to someone in India!  Whilst the tellers at the branch chat amongst themselves.  Anyone entering the branch can hear you giving your personal details and HSBC do not care and If you have any problems there is more convoluted route! I have been with HSBC for years but I have had enough of their shoddy service. I am off!            
                Long & multiple tales of interaction with HSBC 1. No responses to SME banking customers requests including assistance in making payments for statutory taxes to government of India 2. No action on SME business banking account closure request 3. Charges debited after more than 6 months ... and without intimation 4. Multiple excuses for non action on requests 5. On threatening them with legal action, they simply close the bank account stating "AS REQUESTED BY YOU" TRULY, HSBC is meant only for financial frauds and not for normal business people            
                I sent more than 10 emails to HSBC   bank and explained everything. The   scam company Hastings Insurance   took 341.12 from my account about a   month ago and I sent HSBC 10 emails   and said I am in abroad please return   my money back as I do not know them ,   they returned money back. I could not   check my online banking account for 3   weeks I did it last day and saw they   returned money back to That Scam   company Hasting Insurance which I   told them in my emails that I do not   know them at all. I called HSBC and   talked to Ms Lisa Duron and she said   for my account security they can not   answer me and I need to go to the   branch for this problem while I am  not   in the Uk and told them I am in abroad.   It is really strange that the concern for   my account security from me not they   do anything for that scam action and   they support them while I sent them   more than 10 emails and explained   everything in English!!!!  I want my 341.12 which HSBC returned   to those scam back to my account   immediately without anything as I am in   abroad and they can not reach me   except if they call the number which I   provided them yesterday and changed   in mt online banking.HSBC is one of the worst.            
                I have been treated very badly by HSBC on my business account. Pre recession 2008 they could not throw money at me fast enough, but now it's a case of the door is firmly shut.The double standards, lies and hypocrisy stink, and they have 'relationship managers' that are little more than receptionists, no authority whatsoever.I have been refused a modest business overdraft (less than Â£300) due to 'account conduct' yet they are happy to put me in an overdraft position by taking their fees and charges from my account, then charge me again for being in an unauthorised overdraft!I have a business relationship manager who is incapable of even the most basic of decisions and causes more problems than they solve.Please do not use HSBC for any banking ever, it will be the worst decision that you make.            
                I have to say my experience after 4 weeks trying to apply for an online HSBC mortgage was very poor the online application is poor, does not help and they promise to get back to you and notify you on progress but don't...I have to start again but this time with a friendly local building society.            
                We transferred a large amount of money from an International account only to find out HSBC would sit on it for 3 days before putting it on our account. Called a few numbers and after an hour had to hang up as no useful information was given, just standard answers like security and misleading information about their internal processes. Now way offereed to speed up the process            
                I think they're a great bank for the average customer. Was previously with a large bank that begins with the letter B which was like dealing with a bunch of toddlers. Moving to HSBC was a great decision. I haven't borrowed any money from them, I just use them for day to day banking.HSBC are professional and I've had no problems with them since I joined in 2008. Cards are sent out quickly, the website is always working and I can usually get through in under 5 minutes when I occasionally have to phone. The Android app is quite good, but could be improved slightly. Call centres are overseas, however.            
                I have had both personal and business accounts with HSBC for a few years. The bank deals with new customers like with criminals - again, both personal & business. Unexpected rates or fees apply occasionally.Not recommended.            
                I have an HSBC UAE account that I am trying to close from the UK but need a secure key to do so.  HSBC UAE uses a call centre in India whose phone lines are clearly obsolete - in 9 attempts to obtain the secure key, I have been cut off mid-call 9 times because the lines are so poor (each re-call has obviously required re-verification etc so these 9 calls have involved over 90 minutes on the phone and goodness knows how much money on an international line).Local HBSC branch in the UK regretted they couldn't help get a UAE secure key but suggested I open an account in the UK and link them, which I did.  Unfortunately, to link them, you need a UAE secure key.  A further hour on the phone to HSBC's UK call centre (based in Malta) revealed that they can only help with matters relating to HSBC UK and that I would have to just keep trying to call the UAE call centre.  I am left with Â£27,000 stranded in the UAE because:- in reliance on HSBC's misrepresentations that they are an international bank, I opened an account with them over alternative banks in the UAE that may actually have invested in call centre infrastructure;- the UK board has negligently delegated such discretion to their international arms that customers located outside of a particular jurisdiction are unable to access their funds because of this lack of investment and - contrary to their tag line that they are "the world's local bank", their branches and call centres operate in a mono-country vacuum.            
                HSBC froze my account a couple of times when people sent me money and accused me of fraud!  That's rich coming from them since HSBC is known to have laundered drug money for Mexican drug cartels.Needless to say I have now closed my HSBC account...            
                I have been banking with these people for over 10 years. Until recently i never had a problem, but wait until you hear this.I had a tax bill to pay and couldnt do it online because my user limit was too low. Nearing the deadlind to pay my tax i decided to visit the branch to pay the bill via chaps instead. The assistant advised me that instead of getting charged to do a chaps transfer he could increase my online limit - which would be done in a couple of hours, enabling me to do my tax online as originally intended.I gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited until the following day to do my transaction - No surprise - It hadnt been done!I proceeded to ring the bank on the Saturday and explained the whole thing. I was told that my manager (who allegedly was the one who had already sorted it) would ring me on Monday _ He didnt!!I rang back on Tuesday seeing as how he hadnt bothered ringing me. After getting through to someone called Jody who lectured me on NOT using my wifes online banking, she then proceeded to ask me a security question on........you guessed it - Online banking!! So i told her that the whole episode is a Joke and that i would be visiting the branch to try and sort it - Wish me Luck!! I wil keep you posted!  Pathetic that such a simple thing is so hard. And to add insult to injury i will have a Â£100 FINE FROM HMRC winging its way to me - courtesy of HSBC INCOMPETENCE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            
                I tried to exchange sterling for dollars, and then transfer it from an account here to an account in the United States.   My American Bank gave me all the information they needed, including the sort code for a middle, brokering bank.  Though HSBC's computer printout showed a space for this, the quite helpful clerk showed me that the computer wouldn't allow it to be filled in, so they concluded it wasn't really necessary.  Surprise! the money went over, was returned and I had a transfer fee plus two exchange fees to pay.  The same thing happened to a friend who was transferring a large sum for a son who is studying in America, I tried Barclay's, and they managed it perfectly.  RM            
                I recently applied for and received an HSBC credit card yet I am unable to activate it. Apparently there is an upgrade that occurred and no one is able to do anything. I first off went to the branch and they advised of this issue and to call their call centre. I then called and waited for 16 minutes before giving up as I couldn't wait any longer. Every other time I call I get the same message - "We are currently experiencing technical difficulties.." followed by "We are experiencing a high number of calls..." So far I have had a credit card that I am unable to use for the last 3 weeks. I wouldn't recommend this bank to anyone            
                I am a Premier customer, just seeking to open a (second) joint account with my wife. Called Premier helpline - unable to give me the phone number for local branch!! Local branch only open 0930-1630 weekdays, not weekends. Can't get an appointment at either of closest branches to my home. If HSBC don't want me to open another account I will happily go to one of their competitors - Metro Bank? Can't be more difficult than this!! Are they aware customers have other things to be doing than chasing HSBC!! Don't deserve my business.            
                Really complicated and bad customer service! They have 'live chat' on their website, there is nothing Live about it EVER!! I left my details and they never called! In branches it's a disaster, employees don't know what to do, visited 3 different ones! The worst bank ever!! Such a difference to go to Barclays! Friendly and fast service!            
                I accidentally broke my phone Late November 2014. Called HSBC and they were super helpful, and I got my phone sent off within 2 days of calling them.Problems started there. The company they employ to asses phones tried to fix it, I had to wait close on 6 days to get it back. Got it back and it was still no good. Sent it back again and then after another 7 days they told me it could not be fixed, and they could not give me the same phone back. It was a LG Nexus 5 which was only 2 months old when I broke it. Now it's 13th January 2015 and I am still awaiting my replacement phone. As HSBC can not give me the same phone, and I had a choice of only 2 phones. REALLY rubbish service, A choice of a Samsung S4 or a Moto LTE phone. I would think as they can not offer me my model back, maybe they could offer the next model up which is released? but no, it's take it of leave it. So I pay for insurance through them, and they tell me what I will get.  Really sad when the customer basically has to take it or leave it.            
                I don't understand why the bad reviews, every time I had to contact HSBC they've always done what I've asked them to. Once I reduced my overdraft limit by more than I actually had available by mistake online and I put myself in unarranged overdraft. I contacted them straight away on Friday 10pm, was told will be contacted in the morning as there was nobody to authorise the increase. The next day at 9am (Saturday)  I have been called to confirm the overdraft has been increased back up to the amount I wanted to and no charges would be applied. I requested a written confirmation to advise this would not affect my credit report - which it came, 2 days later. My issue was resolved In less than 12 hours people.Reading some of the reviews on here I'm wondering wether people should first pass some kind of IQ test before opening ANY bank account.... I mean, leaving the account overdrawn by Â£20 odd for six days and then wonder why they had to pay default charges (!?) Are you 12 years old and your mum forgot to remind you to check you bank account? Or people complaining about their business accounts and spell "waisted time"... I work for a bank, but not this one. I work for a smaller bank and see stuff like this happen everyday. Once I had a customer who couldn't understand that if the bank applies charges (overdraft fee, interest or package fee - something that a customer had agreed to, by signing the contract)  onto an account with insufficient funds, but then those charges get refunded by an agent (after you shout and scream at us, and that you have 6 children etc), it doesn't mean those funds are available to you. Yes! We have refunded you, but those funds were never available to you In the first place, it just means you don't need to pay them off! It's simple maths! Another thing that grates on my nerves is when people go on holiday and tell their bank to not stop their card whilst abroad. It's not up to the agent on the other side of the phone. It's up to the fraud team and wether you've used a high risk store from a banks point of view. Procedures are there to protect the customer and their money, besides, the bank doesn't care if you advise them before you go on holiday, sorry to break it to you, but it doesn't make a slight difference. If fraud thinks the transaction is dodgy, they will do everything to protect you! (and remember, it's your responsibility to update your personal details, so don't forget to update your mobile number so they can contact you, because they will - with a speed of light.)People are responsible for their own bank accounts, they should know what comes in and comes out, they should be able to manage their finances and most of all stop spending money they don't have. Also, stop going on dodgy websites and paying for a cream sample that costs 99p but in T&C says the next payment will be for Â£89.99 ( which of course haven't been read) and THEN read the reviews from other people, with the same level of intelligence who have been scammed.Sometimes I feel like I'm dealing with children in adult bodies.            
                The home page and online banking could be much more straightforward, but I am quite satisfied with their service generally.One strange thing: we opened account at the same time with my wife, our salaries and savings are quiet similar. Since then, they have offered me a credit card and upgraded my account, but nothing for her.            
                Whenever i call just as i am about to connect to a advisor the call fails. Everytime. So im being charged for the call but not actually speaking to anyone its probly a scam to charge you.            
                Hi,I recently opened an account with HSBC after horrific experiences with my previous bank. I was told that HSBC has good customer service for a bank. Unfortunately, the good service lasted only till the account was opened and has been tremendously disappointing since then. Last Friday, I realized that my debit card has been blocked fearing some hacking attempt on the card. I was not informed about this before the card was blocked. I only realized it after calling customer care. All branches were closed on Friday. You blocked my debit card. You told me I could use my credit card to withdraw money from the bank account (not credit account) only after 24 hours. So, you left me stranded without any cash and closed off every possible avenue for me to get cash on that day. How can I trust a bank, which takes your money but doesn't allow you to withdraw it? You call me every other day asking me if I want a new credit card or if I want a personal loan or some other product you are trying to sell me. You, who could call me for every sales pitch at any hour of the day, couldn't make one call to inform me that my debit card was going to be blocked? Where is your customer focus? Does it stop at sales? No wonder people hate banks. You cannot be trusted with people's money anymore. Your processes and  policies towards customers seemed to be geared at causing as much inconvenience as possible to the people who bank with you. You are holding our money hostage against us. Even the apparent 'help' you give us is only on the surface to calm us down for a minute. I was promised I would be able to withdraw money using my credit card within 24 hours. I tried after 2 days and it didn't work, which I expected. Now, if I want cash, only avenue available to me is either borrow from someone else, or withdraw money from credit card account (since bank account is not yet opened on it) and incur hefty charges which goes into your profits. You are trying to make money by feeding off the misery of the people. This is what is called daylight robbery. You are turning into a bunch of thieves and con-men. From a global bank, this was not what I expected. Minimum standards of customer service and courtesy is non-existent. Shame on you people for your dishonest intentions and malicious practices. I don't know which is worse - this being your sheer incompetence or the deep seated fraudulent and deceitful practices. Hope you understand the extent of inconvenience and trouble that I faced due to your actions and through no fault of my own, which has resulted in me penning this letter. Regards,Disgruntled Customer            
                I have been with HSBC for 30 years.  My eldest son is with them because I took him to the local branch and now my younger son has opened an account.  Just a couple of months ago our local branch closed.  Youngest son was trying to set up online banking.  He rang and the person took all his passwords etc and then said the system was down and he needed to go into a branch.  We checked our nearest branch and went on Sat am.  It wasn't open so we headed for a bigger branch some miles away, it wasn't open, so we went to the city centre branch but they don't do counter service on Saturdays.  You can only speak to someone in person between 0900 and 1700 Mon to Fri at any branches within a 30 mile radius (possibly anywhere in the country).  I work and my son is at school and doesn't drive.  How is he supposed to get to a branch to speak to someone and show them his documents between 0900 and 1700 midweek?  In the end I picked him up in my lunchtime and drove to the bank.  They didn't want to see him without an appointment (I wanted to scream)  but fortunately I had printed the HSBC sheet that said 'just pop into your local branch'.  So, once set up, he paid in a building society cheque.  The cashier said it would be in that day.  Five days later he tried to purchase something online and, although his balance was showing the deposited cheque, his card was rejected at the online checkout without explanation.  We rang HSBC and they said the cheque hadn't cleared.  Why doesn't it say that on the account?  The whole thing is a joke. He can't believe it, his first experience of banking and its a joke.  These young people are used to speedy service and immediate answers, they use their mobiles all the time and are constantly downloading and sharing info -  to them,  this sort of service is like something from the dark ages.            
                No customer service and internet banking is terrible            
                I have been with HSBC for 8 years and had mortgage with it two years ago. I had to move my mortgage to another bank because its changing policy.Recently I got letters saying that my HSBC account is to be closed. The staff at branch is slow and not helpful at all. When I mentioned this with my friends, some of them also suffered the similar HSBC SPECIAL rude and unbelievable GETTING RID OF services. When I checked on internet, there are also many similar stories. What a SO CALLED WORLD BANK!  I am not supervised when HSBC itself is closing one day.            
                The approach HSBC have to security is so over the top there is a very detrimental effect to the service you receive. Moreover departments do not speak to each other so you tell the same information to different people over and over again.Issue 1).I've had my card cancelled and re-issued more times than I care to mention. The end result is a I am frequently left without access to money. The trigger is always buying something online from reputable sites. This is 2014 and online shopping should not be classed a suspicious activity.Issue 2)We were in Paris on holiday and my cards got suspended. However I'd already called HSBC the day before and told them I was heading there. I was not a security risk, it was the opposite. What could be more secure than telling them where I was going to be in the future. The end result was presents could not be bought and I spent my holiday waiting to speak to HSBC to resolve the matter. Holiday was tarnished.Issue 3)I needed to transfer a large sum the same day. I did this in person in branch with photo ID in my lunch. At 17.56 the same day I got a voicemail saying they'd suspended the transfer. I called back at 18.01 and the dept was closed. It took until 9.45am the next day to resolve the matter. End result: the money did not get transferred the same day. They will not recompense me for the fee. They will not acknowledge the costs I've to bear for the money not being transferred the same day as I needed it to be.            
                When something goes wrong like rude careless customer service, there is no one to complain to. If you get through to someone they will take about an hour of transferring you to someone who will then just put the phone down. Take the matter further if you have time and are lucky and insistent enough, well all you'll get is someone higher up who will be rude unhelpful and then they will put the phone down on you. Absolutely hopeless. It isn't just one or two but it is company attitude/policy. Avoid avoid avoid you will regret it sooner or later. My advice go to First Direct and feel like royalty when they serve you as a valued customer            
                I'm now working in north east Scotland where the nearest HSBC branch is a 2 hour round trip. This is away from my home address.The nearest branch has unhelpful opening times and are only open monday to friday 9-5 (when I'm at work) then for a few hours of degraded service on saturday and there is no counter service to cash a cheque.When I walk into a HSBC branch, their employees always tell me to phone a call centre as the staff in the branch do not help. The advisor on the phone speaks poor English and cannot pronounce the name of companies I've made transactions with or pronounce the name of the nearest branch, Inverness.It took 6 working days to receive a replacement credit card, then the PIN arrives another 6 working days later. HSBC do not send you any confirmation the card has been dispatched or has arrived at the branch, you have to turn up and hope for the best. If you get the card posted to your address the PIN can only be activated in nearest HSBC ATM... which for me at the moment is a 2 hour round trip.Then the PIN failed to activate as the chip on the new card that HSBC had sent me is faulty. Why are they sending out faulty cards, do they not check these or have any quality control? So HSBC said a new PIN needed to be sent out again. I try that 6 days later and still nothing. So yet another credit card needs to be sent out, we are going around in circles here.Then my debit card would not make a online transaction despite having funds in my bank account. I have to phone the HSBC call centre where, after I was put on hold for a considerable time and passed from department to department, they speak poor English again. A person on the phone asks for my bank card details despite the fact I've already typed it in the phone keypad, this is a breach of security as they could have been anyone asking for my card number. Then another advisor on phone decides to cancel my debit card despite I confirmed I made the transactions, they are legitimate and I have no issue with them. But the phone advisor decides to do what he wants anyway and still cancels my debit card without my permission. He says he will send out another debit card that will arrive 6 working days later at the branch thats hours away.So what does this mean... I have no debit or credit card or access to any of my money for the next several days.How am I supposed to eat? How am I supposed to get to the branch to collect my cards?HSBC haven't solved any of my banking problems. They just add to the problems.            
                Here a list of my recent experinces of what you can't do with HSBC;- Login to internet banking because there website is down- Increase the credit limit on a credit card- Make a payment to a credit card because HSBC decides to cancel the transaction with out notification- Speak to a person in customer service that knows what they are doing- Have mail sent to your new address- Have mail directed to a branch because they send it to your old address again- Set up a credit card in under 3 months, because they send mail to anywhere but where they should- Know where you are and what accounts you have. Sorry sir we can't offer you credit at this time as you don't reside in this country. But HSBC you have already issued me with a credit card!!Here's what HSBC can do;- Waste your time- Charge you massive fees- Make you a coffee if you go into the branch            
                For the past, oh gosh, it must be nearing 3 years now, I have been asking them on average about once a month to send me the tools I need for online banking. Every time I am promised the password decoder in the post within 7 days and I have never ever received it. I have called on a number of occasions only to be spoken to in a very rude manner (one woman even audiably sighed when I asked for some assistance!). The stars I have given are mainly for the staff in my local branch - the guys in Victoria, London are great! When I was a student HSBC were very reluctant to give me the student over draft that was in fact promised to me with my student account, because I didn't have regular in-goings and out-goings. No. I was a student. It took a full year. I knew this wasn't right as I accompanied my friend to her bank (she was less financially stable than I was) and they gave her what she was entitled to no questions asked.Really pathetic show, HSBC.            
                A couple of years ago I joined HSBC Premier and also took out two business accounts with much promise of 'know the customer' and 'personalised service.'Now there is no Premier relationship manager and no business manager on my accounts.  It's all gone back to just 'computer says no.'  And boy can they say no.  They send me a lot of marketing and sales materials, but no service whatsoever,.HSBC's venture into the world of small business appears to have been over promised and under resourced.  Worst decision I ever made to move there.They are extremely rude, too.            
                We have been Premier customers of HSBC for a number of years - and have been fairly happy with the service received.  That is until we decided to liquidate our stocks and shares ISA's and re-invest in cash ISA's also with HSBC.What a trauma that turned into ---- the sales and transfers which should have taken around 10 to 15 days to achieve - took  around 30 + days.  This was against a backdrop of a falling stock market and lost us a significant amount of money. It took a complaint to the chief executive and a lot of push and chasing to eventually get a recognition that their delays had cost us money and to secure a refund.Whilst we have recouped our losses the stress and experience of selling shares with HSBC has shattered our confidence and I would avoid like the plague.  The PIMS product is not fit for purpose , it is arrogant and does not treat customers fairly            
                I've been a Premier customer in four branches between the UK and France. The level of incompetence for a so-called Premier service is mind-blowing. Files get lost, account managers change all the time with each new one completely unaware of your history, crazy hidden fees keep popping out of nowhere despite already paying through the nose for a monthly subscription. And that's for a Premier account which never had a single problem! Can't imagine what it must be like for non-premier customers. I finally managed to close my account. I feel like a free man. I feel a bit stupid for lasting 8 years with them to be honest, but each new branch kept telling me they weren't like the previous one. Lesson learnt.            
                Broken promises. Pass you from piller to post. I'm only rating the HSBC business telephone banking team and the Chorlton branch in Manchester 1 star as there is no zero star option.            
                I am only rating them 1 star as there is no zero star option. I took over the treasury role for a small local organisation in January this year. This involved creating a revised mandate for the 2 accounts we have. We were to have 2 new signatories on the accounts, remove 2 and keep 2 others on there. 4 signatories in total of which any 2 would be able to sign cheques. Problems were encountered right from the start, first it was that they would not accept any instruction from me, as I was not yet a signatory. Secondly they would not accept any instruction form the previous Treasurer as he was no longer a signatory. They were however still sending all correspondence to his address. Next, they couldn't get our name right, they weren't prepared to accept minutes of our AGM as proof that we were who we said we were, as the name was different to what they thought it was, despite us providing proof that there was no such entity as they thought we were.Then after this was eventually sorted, they decided they needed new proofs of address and ID for all signatories on the account. Including the 2 who were already signatories. They refused the ID provided by one of the signatories, for no apparent reason, but anyway he eventually  went into the local branch (Ipswich) with documentation he was assured was sufficient. Hooray!, we assumed, this is it finally (now mid-October after initialising this in January), the mandate will now be agreed and we can carry on as before. Except no, on Saturday I got a letter saying they had been instructed to close the accounts, with no further explanation, plus a cheque attached for the closing balance, made out in the wrong name.HSBC are without doubt the worst organisation I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!            
                My bank account was shut down yesterday with NO prior warning!My card was chumped up by a machine whilst on the other side of London leaving me stranded with no cash to hand! Thank goodness my Oyster card was already topped up!They claimed that they sent letters and that "we only use Royal Mail darling" and yet the only mail I've EVER received from them is a June to September bank statement!So it's MY fault, the customer, that I'm not receiving their letters yet they have my mobile number AND email address and they contacted me on NEITHER.I was told this was the best bank to come to if you own a business or are planning to, well this is a DISGUSTING way to treat a small business owner!I'm sorry my little business is bringing YOU any money!!!            
                I'm disgusted by HSBCs out right refusal to refund me my bank charges when all most every other bank has agreed to refund the same charges to their customers , it is very rare that HSBC will refund or like other banks offer a amount as goodwill , just goes to show the richer a company the tighter they are !14 yrs of banking with HSBC and this is what I get Well thank you and good bye HSBC !I'd rather bank with someone who actually looks out for the little people !            
                I've been a HSBC customer since a child when my mum set one up for me, and only really started using them since working in my late teens. I'm now 28 and have never had a problem. I've worked full time, part time, lived abroad, been in higher education, and have always been treated well.They communicate well when updating policies, have never had a problem with their online banking, and although they outsource their calls to somewhere I'm not sure, they are polite and helpful.I was mis sold a PPI in 2007 and claimed it back, and they were helpful along the way. I have heard horror stories about other banks in the UK, but have never had such issues here. We may all hate the big banks, but I would recommend HSBC as being a good one.            
                HSBC are useless at everything they do. I was with them for years and i went in to sign for a loan, i spoke to an extremely rude arrogant "child". i believe it is safe to surmise i have had my bank account prior to his birth. I put in a complaint about him and although it was followed up i had had another issue in the meantime with them.The telephone staff are inadequate, and do not listen, considering this was once known as the listening bank!! I decided to leave as i did not feel very supported and EVERY time you enter a branch you are asked to wait for up to an hour, not ideal really. Then i received a letter asking me to claim PPI. I filled it in as they had sent it. The generated letter back is disgusting it accuses you of going direct to them, when they invited you. But ok none due, i received a letter saying my account hadn't been used and it would be closed. This didn't bother me as i had joined another bank, very helpful and NEVER keep you waiting for an hour even though they are busy. I decided to go in and close it down, i spoke to an extremely helpful person who looked at the account told me to claim for PPI and i wouldn't lose my online banking access for the loan i had with them. I have lost my online banking, which fills me with confidence i did the right thing in leaving the worst ever bank, namely HSBC. She did print me out all my accounts and told me to claim again after i had filled her in about an invite to PPI but a decline of it. She told me that i was  bound to be due some from what she could see.I sent a letter to the complaints department and a copy to the PPI people asking for a review and if them sending me a letter was a ploy to avoid payment. plus a lot of other questions for them.Well i had a response saying i was entitled to PPI, however the response was they were not going to look into my questions or answer anything i had asked and basically taking the money is an end to it. No letter from the complaints department even to apologise, what a cop out from HSBC. Obviously they feel throwing a bit of money at people is the easy way out for them. Also when/if it was them calling, i appreciate that validation needs to happen, but all the scams about and they ask for account number and postcode. They could ask for something that wont cause concern to a customer.However going on my experience over the last year with them, i can only conclude again this is a ploy to avoid dealing with customers. I feel that giving them ONE star is far too generous. I am really disappointed with HSBC after 22 years, they disgust me. My recommendation, stay well clear, if i can save just one person the nightmare i had then i will be happy.            
                I turned 17 in summer 2013 and I was advised by my family that maybe it was about time I got myself a proper bank account, and I chose HSBC because it seemed to look the best.Anyway, apart from a few initial sign up problems, I had no issues with HSBC until just short of a year later.I received the general letters about changes to my account with me turning 18 a few months later, and I just happened to start reading the leaflet they sent me regarding contactless cards. It said that the eligibility for one was age 17 and above. Anyway, I headed to the Leeds City Centre branch to deposit some money and a lady who was working there asked me if I needed any help, so I enquired about the card. She told me they'd need more ID so I showed her my driving licence and she said it was enough but told me I could still have one, but I'd be better off waiting until I am 18. This was absolutely fine by me as I was due to turn 18 at the end of that month anyway. So I decided to wait. A few days after my birthday, I headed to a different branch (one more local to where I live and where my account was registered) and a lady helped me deposit a cheque and I asked her when I would get my new card. She told me it should come through automatically.I didn't only just want the card for the contactless facility, but also the higher withdrawal limit and other adult benefits. But I left it a month waiting for it to come through and it didn't, therefore I called customer services. I had to press I don't know how many buttons before I was put through to some man in India who I couldn't understand. But he told me I wasn't eligible but wouldn't tell me why. I took another visit into the Leeds branch where the same lady I spoke to a few months before, told me it should come automatically as well. But it didn't. She told me I could wait, but that I'd have to wait a while.I put a complaint in, and the man helped me out, have me a good will gesture of Â£50 and sent me a new card. But it still wasn't the right one. Eventually he did but it was too late because I'd registered to another bank.I left a three star review here because they did help eventually. But it's dropped to one now after they seriously messed me around again...A few months ago, I was looking around for a new credit card, one that I could use abroad at no extra cost as I'm going to be away for a few months this summer. And I stumbled across HSBC's student account. I thought about it for a while and a while later I went back and signed up for it. I just thought I'd give them another chance.It caught my eye that they were offering a Â£60 Amazon Voucher with the account, and it reeled me in to get it. I just thought having a student overdraft would come in handy in case of an emergency. I didn't get the credit card as I managed to get one to use abroad with another provider.After applying, I didn't hear anything for a while. But then I got some letters telling me I needed to show various identification documents in branch. So I did this, but I waited in the Leeds city centre branch for over two hours to be seen to. Just to check some documents..but eventually everything went smoothly. I received my card and everything really quickly and everything looked good.But no Amazon voucher..? I waited ages for it. I shop quite a lot on Amazon so this voucher reeled me into getting this account. I kept checking the website for the offer, it was still there but nothing. So I emailed customer services, where I just got a snotty email saying it was only valid if you signed up before September 2015. I replied back saying it was false advertising but I just got ignored.I wanted to get screenshots, but as soon as I sent that, it had been removed from the website. I emailed a complaint again and the guy told me there was a delay in removing it, but it was in the small print (I never saw it but whatever..) but as a good will gesture, he credited my account with Â£60 instead. It's just a joke that you have to go higher up to get results. It goes to show that they proved to be the same when I gave them a second chance. I'm thinking of closing this account down again and definitely not going back in the future!            
                If hell has a bank it will be HSBC. nuff said.            
                they dont treat their customers well. they tell you of this credit ratings that are not correct. making excuses for their incompetence.            
                HSBC have ruined my year. No exaggeration. I've been trying to buy my first house and from the moment my mortgage adviser (at another bank!) said 'Computer says no' due to a defaulted card back in 2012 ... I knew something was amiss! You see, I haven't had a credit card since 2009. So I looked at my credit report...and saw their mistake in black and white. Anyway to cut a 4 month long story short, despite several letters, expensive phone calls, emails, reporting them to the Financial Ombudsman (Who found in my favour!) They haven't corrected it...no siree.... they have made it worse...worse than I could possibly imagine! And yet they keep saying in a whinny 3 year old voice "We've dooooonnneee itttt! We've fixxxxxeeed it! It's not ouuuurrr fauuuult! We've said sorrrry!" *Stomps their multi billion pound feet and slams the door!* What takes the proverbial biscuit though is the fact that after a rather exasperating half and hour (Â£10!) phone call to 'Paolo' at Metropolitan who couldn't understand me and was determined that I was a complete imposter who just gets off on trying to correct HSBC's mistakes... gave me a number for the 'complaints department'. So I called "Ring ring, ring ring... No one can take your call right now...but there are sexy ladies in your area who want to...." I don't know what they wanted to do but I'm guessing it wasn't put my account right. HSBC adviser did the whole "Ha, oh must have been a mistake!" thing. To which I asked her if I looked like I was born yesterday? Old Paolo was annoyed at my annoyance and impatience with spelling out everything like "H ... yes as in Hotel... A, R...what? Oh A as in Apple...R as in Really getting on my nerves!" (I have 10 letters in my surname!) So he thought it would be one in the eye for me if he made me call that number which cost me to connect! I mean...how offensive and unprofessional! I'd get fired if I did that! Anyway...I'm sat here today waiting for the phone call (which I fear will never come) to tell me... yes we've actually fixed it properly this time. In short, HSBC didn't do their job properly first time around, now I'm trying to put that right before I ceremoniously leave! They haven't helped one bit, they don't care about customer service, they don't want customer satisfaction. They don't even care about doing their job right. I advise anyone looking for a bank .... don't join here! Don't do it, you WILL regret it. And all those existing customers...just check your credit reports, because which ever numpty put mine in wrong on that fatal day 5 years ago may have done the same to you. Perhaps they were calling the Sexy ladies at the time......!            
                HSBC bank can't handle any information, they just throw it away ! They do some records of me and the record's tells that I'm living abroad and therefore I have to give them a copy of my passport and tell them where I live.I life in UK, I work in UK, my salary is from UK, I pay tax in UK, and I have been to the bank and proof i'm actually live in UK two times now, and they just putting my copy in a trash bin or something and they just want to take there customers time to do it again and again. Do NOT choose this bank is waste of time and I go for another bank.            
                I am absolutely appalled by the time taken for the telephone banking team to process a simple transaction (transfer of funds to another non-HSBC UAE bank account).I use Internet Banking whenever possible, as I have noticed a deterioration in the Telephone Banking service for some years now, but today I am unable to login and was forced to call in.The connection was lost, I was put on hold numerous times, for several minutes at a time (after being told to wait 1 minute).  I started the call  at just after midnight and now it is past 2:30 am and I am on hold again, awaiting final approval for the transaction.. waiting 15 minutes so far...The agent was unable to locate the Beneficiary branch, after i provided the SWIFT code.IBAN numbers for the UAE all begin with AE, the agent did not seem to know this and put in AT , as this is what he thought he had heard.This had to be corrected and the whole thing resubmitted - again put on hold ... technical problem.. now being transferred to another team-member.This is not the level of service one would expect from ANY bank, let alone a multinational such as HSBC.  I am disgusted and will sharing my experience with all my friends, other HSBC customers, my press contacts and social media.Sort yourselves out, this is the 21st century.            
                Having been a customer for over 10 years I've had both good and bad experiences with HSBC.However I must say having gone through the complaints procedure after being unhappy I have received quick and comprehensive answers. They have dealt with all problems effectively and always tried to help me out whenever I'm having financial difficulties.Overall things always run smoothly, their loan application was simple and straight forward with an instant decision and their customer service has always been top notch!            
                I hear that HSBC won't tell you where your personal data is processed. This means that it could be being read by someone in a country where there's no Data Protection legislation like there is in Europe.  That means that your personal banking details may not be as secure as you thought and you could be at risk of identity fraud.            
                I am pulling everything out of their banks.  Never once have I had satisfactory service.  I don't demand a lot. All I ask is for someone to give and take my money and manage my account.  These idiots working in there are horrible.  There's no customer service training what so ever!!!  Mr. Romeo Guerra, You are absolutely terrible hiding behind that suit and tide is a God awful, heartless person.  You should be terminated on the spot if management knows about how you treat your customers in Huntington!!!  Shame on you            
                Having worked in customer service myself for a number of years, you come to appreciate decent customer service!someone managed to get hold of our details and used my card fraudulently - within hours I received a phone call, had my card stoped and within the week the money is now bring refunded.The entire team of people were polite, courteous and sensitive to my responses.  Yes, they were based in India, but frankly, they could be based on the moon for all I care; I've worked in Europe and further afield with all and sundry, and good customer service is about the service, not where of who runs the service centre.My issue is in the process of bring resolved - and it is the efficiency and professionalism of the entire uncomfortable matter that has left me with an overall impression of respect for the team.            
                My husband passed away in 2013. Probate was required as he had a PIMS managed ISA investment account. It took months for them to supply the information necessary for probate. Probate was achieved in 3 weeks...no problem. Then back to HSBC PIMS department to apply the settlement.The solicitor is appalled by their incompetence,  phone calls not returned, important original documents lost or declared 'not received !!!'To quote the solicitor 'All banks are bad when it comes to probate but HSBC takes the biscuit'. Every time another letter has to be rewritten,resigned by the executors and sent again to HSBC,it will be added to my final bill.Needless to say I shall be removing my investments from HSBC.            
                If you are looking for a bank, don't chose HSBC. I had countless bad experiences with HSBC. - telephone banking system automatic log in: never works, very bad system- it took me 30 min to change my address when visiting a branch, in NatWest it took me 5 minutes. - they shut down my account due to "inactivity" (even though I was active online, was communicating with bank staff etc)  - it took me 3 months to get it un-locked (HSBC Dubai). - it took me 4 months (several calls, several letters sent, several emails sent) to close my account (HSBC India). - I visited their branch in the UK, talked 30 min with a customer agent - 5 days later I get a letter that they will shut down my account "due to inactivity". - They always hide behind some "rules". Worst bank ever, don't touch it.            
                Abysmal Customer Service !I am a inbound customer service agent and was livid at the way I have been treated by call centre staff at HSBC !!! Firstly I would like to let you know I am gay and sound like a women on the phone. 4 times I have been personally attacked by their staff on the phone, even throu passing through there security I am still told "you are not Mr *****" "you are lieing" and 4 TIMES my account has been blocked because the UNDER TRAINED & UNCOMPREHENSABLE agent dosent believe who I am !!!??? I am all for call centres being in other countrys it gives people in other countries jobs whitch they so desperately need! How dare you be so rude to me!! Other banks such as Nationwide & Bank of Scotland have poped on my account notes I sound like a women on the phone & have NEVER blocked my account they are fantastic a samples of a good bank and customer service. Never bank with HSBC if you don't sound normal as you will be discriminated against !!!!!            
                Something which I will be sending to heads of customer experience and managers of each branchTo the Manager.I am writing to you to express the absolute dissatisfaction with every aspect of doing business with HSBC. This includes your product, your store staff, your call center and processes. Here is a summary of the inconvenience and embarrassment which both my partner, friends and I had to endure dealing with the total incompetence of a âglobal bankâ and people within your organization.1.        Moving to the UK for work, I opened an account in Australia, then applied for an international account which cost me $300AUD. I spent about $50aud on phone calls, and at least 3 hours  speaking with the UK trying to get my UK internet banking arranged. There are multiple tweets requesting someone to call me, which they claim were attempted. Doubt it.2.        My partner and I arrived in the UK on the 28th March, and I had the primary everyday account. So my partner could access the funds we made an appointment with your Oxford St branch 196 oxford St with John Manning so we could add him to the account. After spending at least an hour with John we left expecting that Matt would receive a card in the post with access to internet banking and a Pin Number.3.        A week past, and on the 13th April  I called your call centre to enquire when the card and pin would arrive. After putting my security passwords and card details into the IVR, the HSBC representative greeted me as Matt Adam (my partners name)!!! The representative continued to call me by the wrong name, and explained that the account had been moved into his name, and there was NO additional card for this account. The call went nowhere and I hung up. I tweeted @HSBC_UK_HELP about my dissatisfaction â they just directed me call. 4.        On the 21st of April, my partner and I went into the Oxford St branch again (my partner waited about 40minutes to see someone) to explain the situation. The man who was helping us said we had to make yet another appointment to see someone. There were no convenient times (making appointments to fix your mistake is far from convenient) â and they said we could fix the issue at any branch and there were no appointments for some time, so make an appointment at the Bond St Branch for the 24th.5.        On the 24th  of April we came in at 9am for our appointment â where the Manager of the branch came to assist the person trying to help. After quite a bit of back and forth, they came to the conclusion that they would not be able to help us and we would need to make yet another appointment at the Oxford St office who originally made the mistake, and they would need to resolve the issue. I was clearly unimpressed and expressed my frustration â they then said that they could start the paperwork and send it over to the Oxford St branch for processing, which would give us a joint account, with our own cards and access to internet and telephone banking . Because my card still worked and needed to access funds, I clearly said I do not want them to cancel this card until the new one is active. The woman reassured me that I would still be able to access my account with my card until the new one arrived.6.        The next week, I called customer service to find out how long it takes for funds to clear in my account (as I was expecting to be paid by my employer on the 28th of April) When going through the IVR, the representative said they were unable to discuss my account because âfor security reasonsâ it has been locked and if I wanted to âunlockâ my telephone banking I would need to go into a branch, make an appointment etc. So at this point, I could access my internet banking but could not speak with anyone on the phone about my account.7.        The following week, I was paid by my company (around the 6th May), and attempted to withdraw funds. But was unable to, stating incorrect pin. I called customer support, again â was told that they could not discuss my account and I would need to go into a branch make an appointment etc,. I logged into internet banking and sent a message banking expressing my frustration and received a replay reference 4676737 telling us to go into a branch. So at this point, I had no way of accessing my money, which meant I could not get to a branch (and also unsure that even if I got to a branch they could help). I tweeted my frustration on the 7th of May expressing my frustration and hoping someone would help â again no help given. 8.        My partner and I had to borrow money from a friend, and he went into the Regent St branch to try and sort the issue out. At this point, the staff had no idea what was going on, they said one card was at the branch but the other had not arrived. (this was now 2 weeks since the Bond St branch had allegedly sorted out the issue). After some further investigation and âlooking out the backâ they found both cards and my partner brought them home. A few days later his pin arrived â but mine hadnât.9.        I went into great Portland st to sort out my blocked telephone banking, and to activate my card. Again, they asked me to wait, and make an appointment. By this point, I refused to wait and demanded they sort it out right away. The woman agreed and unlocked my internet banking and activated my card. I asked if I could set up my pin there, she said no and it would arrive in the post in the next few days.10.     The following week (this week), still no pin for my card. However, cheque books (which we have no need for  - nor did we ask for) arrived, as well as letters advising us that our cards had arrived. (which according to the reference 4676737 had been there for 2 weeks) on the 13th May I rang customer service (again) and they said it had been posted so they would need to cancel that pin, and reissue me with another one. Given the track history dealing with your staff, I was very concerned that our accounts would again be cancelled or mixed up â the representatives reassured me that this would not happen. It is now the 15th May. I still have no pin for my card.While this was going on I started a new extremely stressful job & moved my entire life to the UK from Australia. This involves getting access to money which, unfortunately HSBC continuously failed at.As you can gather, I am beyond dissatisfied with all aspects of the customer service and experience.  My partner and I have wasted hours trying to get a simple task completed both in store and over the phone, this includes time out of the office from my new job. We have had to inconvenience friends by borrowing money, I have also lost money by needing to withdraw money from Australian accounts (with NAB â whose customer service is excellent by the way). At no point throughout this lengthy ordeal have I received a call, email, tweet or any recognition that this had been an absolute shambles and that you value me as a customer.My question to you is, what are you going to do about this â aside from providing me with a fully functioning bank account? My contact information is below, and I am open to suggestions.            
                Our application process for a business account...1. Applied online, my company has 2 directors, application completed in less than half an hour with a result showing 5 green ticks for my colleague who already has a personal HSBC account and 4 ticks for me. I had to print off a form, take it into a local branch to confirm my identity.2. I visit the local branch to be confronted with a member of staff that had never seen the document before or know what to do with it. After checking my passport on some PC online checker she accessed in the bank foyer I was then told to wait whilst she went and found someone who could process it. 20 minutes, and a pathetic apology later I'm told they will send the form off to the account openings dept.3. I hear nothing for a few days so I ring to check progress, I'm told yes they have the identity form and that the application is now in process and will take up-to 5 working days to process.4. On the 5th day after hearing nothing, I ring to check progress, am told the 5th working day is tomorrow.5. I ring back only to be told the 5th working day is tomorrow again.6. I ring again and then am told 'your application has gone to 'referrals'' like I'm supposed to know what that means! All they could tell me is they will need more information from us but it could now take up-to 7 working days and we'd just have to wait until we hear from someone.7. We hear nothing so on the 7th day I ring again. After being kept waiting 23 minutes to be put through to someone I'm then amazingly asked 'do you have time to talk now?' unbelievable! They then proceed to tell me they tried to ring and left a voicemail for me earlier that day and emailed. This was a blatant lie because I work from home and no one had called or left a voicemail or emailed from HSBC. I'm then asked to explain our business operation in more detail which proved to me the person I was speaking to was a complete idiot having no appreciation of how a modern internet based business works. I was made to feel like I was some kind of fraudster, even though we've held a business account with the HSBC in the past 2 years this obviously stood for nothing! The rep then explained that we'd applied for the wrong account type because we'd applied for a switcher account. We don't have an existing account to switch from because we are currently formerly complaining against our existing bank due to the bad service they've given us. So I say 'so your telling me we've got to now start from scratch and apply for a startup account even though we've been trading since 2005?' 'yes' was the response, at which point I say in no uncertain terms that I will take my business elsewhere and will not ever use or recommend HSBC again.The big banks were supposed to be helping small business more after the government had a word in their ears but it seems to me they've made it harder now for small businesses to get an account. This will undoubtedly further the rich get richer and the poor get poorer situation. We've voted with our feet and gone to the Co-Operative Bank who are not only an ethically led bank but actually speak to you like they give a shit about their customers.            
                I am a HSBC customer of ten years. It is not the only bank account I have ever had but it certainly is my longest one. I know a lot people come to review and vent their frustrations and banks generally are very good at getting you frustrated! But in the 10 years I have been with HSBC I have had savers, student and current accounts, a credit card and a small loan. They have always been great over the phone and the hours you can speak to someone (within the UK) have always been better than other banks I have been with. I use the App a lot and I don't have anything to complain about. There is sometimes better deals out there... I investigated recently but I couldn't get hold of anyone from other banks so ended up talking to HSBC and being sorted within 20 mins (compared to 5 phonecalls to santander and getting nowhere!). People in the branches have always been great! Money can be pretty stressful at times - HSBC have always made it easier. Hope this helps!            
                OTheir  banks have the decency to reply to complaints within 24 hours. HSBC are real time wasters. I put in an application to set up a business account 8 months ago. They approved it but then lost the details so closed it. I put in a complaint 2 months ago and have just had a reply by letter that did not address any of the details in the complaint. Banking ombudsman here I come.            
                Tried 4 times unsuccessfully to ask HSBC a couple of simple questions about their mortgage products (because they didn't provide the information online).Last 2 calls - on hold for 1 hour on 1st call then gave up because I thought I might be better trying one of their other contact numbers (I had phoned 0800 032 4706).2nd time (phoned 0800 169 6333) - even worse - still on hold after 2 hours!! I've never experience such poor customer response in all my life.  I've just wasted 3 hours of my weekend trying to contact them!Bottom line - I was considering re-mortgaging with them, but I'm going to take my business elsewhere. Although they offered the best deal, it's not worth the hassle and stress if you need to contact them.I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE ELSE TO TRY A DIFFERENT BANK, ESPECIALLY FOR MORTGAGE PRODUCTS. EVEN IF THEY OFFER THE BEST DEAL, THINK ABOUT THE STRESS AND HASSLE TRYING TO CONTACT THEM FURTHER DOWN THE LINE.            
                I tried to log into my business acct yesterday, using my security token, but it has been suspended because they have apparently sent me a new one???  Note here that not only do you need a new token but also a separate letter with a security code to use to register the new token on online banking.  When I called telephone banking I was advised they don't want to speak to me because I am not the primary acct holder, and that I need to visit my branch.  OK, I go to the branch only to be told there is no longer a business acct functionary there, but was given a business card with details of one that might be able to help me.  While at the branch I get a new token, but when I get home and try to use it I discover it is no use to me without the registration code.  I have spent approximately one hour on hold listening to static while I wait for help that will never come...why am I paying these people Â£5.50 a month?  I have signed up with Lloyd's bank  and will be closing my HSBC acct as soon as humanly possible.  I am a very low maintenance customer, but on the odd occasion when I do need help I expect to get it.  HSBC is screwing me without even kissing me first.  Divorce time!!!            
                I've recently set up a standard business account, but despite having another business account and 2 personal accounts already with HSBC, the process was far from smooth. Case in point: I needed to fill out a form to enable payments through online banking, which I dutifully filled out and dropped off at my branch. 3 weeks and 2 follow up calls later, and I'm still unable to make online payments (the form said it would take 2-5 working days). I just got a call from someone at the branch, who has only just got to my form because he 'just got back'. When I asked from where, he said 'business trip'. I kind of doubt the truth of this. What kind of business sends a middle management employee on a 3 week business trip with no cover? While I don't expect banking to be a luxury experience, HSBC is closer to KFC than BA. In spite of this, the telephone support team are doing a good job. Its sometimes a long wait to get through to someone (that hold music....), but once you do, they are polite, helpful, and feel like a safe pair of hands.            
                Two days before writing this review I joined HSBC. The lady who set up the account was very nice and could not fault her. However a day after first using internet banking my account was suspended pending referral by my local bank manager; being 16 I was quite scared as to what I had done wrong. After speaking to a kind man on the phone the branch the next day called me and said because you are 16 and have three other current accounts with other banks which I didn't tell them about (which I didn't feel was relevant) they had referred my account to the manager to ask me further questions about my account. I have never had this problem with my other banks. To conclude the advisors are very nice but the bank sometimes can just be a pain in the backside. If you are going to join HSBC then just clarify what other accounts you have.            
                On the 1st/2nd of April HSBC closed our company bank account in error, that is to say it was closed without any request from us and or our bank manager.  Initially this meant that several thousands of our money disappeared for 3 days and some of our suppliers went unpaid.On the 2nd of April the call centre at HSBC refused to help, claiming our bank manager requested the account be closed.  Our bank manager denies she asked to have the account closed. A complaint was raised but 14 days later the complaints department has not contacted me.On day three I visited the branch and a branch assistant made some essential payments for me by overriding the account settings and another manager set about getting the account closure reversed. Two payments were made were to Paypal during this visit via the faster payment method.Day 5 and the money had not been credited to my Paypal account, so Paypal began the first of three investigations all of which have confirmed they can not find the money HSBC sent, with the trace information provided or without.  A separate complaint will follow about Paypal.17 days in the bank says it is not their problem they sent the money, Paypal say it is not their problem as they have not received the money and neither side is prepared to do anymore, meanwhile we are missing Â£491 of physical money and a lost a day and a half of our time between dealing with the two of them and counting.            
                I visited my local branch of HSBC in Bishop Auckland because I'm moving in two weeks and wanted to change the address on my account. I was told that I would need to make an appointment with the manager on the day I was moving because otherwise the change would happen straight away and my statements would go to the wrong place. I told her that I couldn't,t come in that day as I would be quite busy moving furniture. She said that I should just redirect my post but when I pointed out that I would would still need to change my details she said I need to go to the branch nearest to my move and  make arrangements  then. ...end of part one...                                                      Two days later I go to HSBC in Glasgow and ask there. A nice young girl says , no problem at all , just bring in your passport and we can do it immediately on any date you require....            
                I'm a mild-mannered person and never usually complain about customer service, but HSBC make me inarticulate with rage. They are the only speed dial on my phone apart from my husband because I need to call them up so often. I could sing their hold music note for note: it haunts my dreams. Each time I call, it takes at least half an hour to resolve the problem (1 hour 16 minutes is my record), because I'm passed from pillar to post, often having to repeat the answers to security questions as if no-one at their end is actually talking to each other. It took me about three weeks to persuade them to set up a recurring payment for my rent, which got me started off on the wrong foot with my landlord. They've blocked my card five times in the past five months, and haven't been able to give me a good reason why. Every time they block the card (for a joint account) they insist on emailing my husband and not myself. On the last occasion, the transaction they found 'suspicious' was a $100 donation to a charity. I could go on but I need to calm down. Do NOT bank with these muppets.            
                Our business banked with HSBC for over a year and found the service to be very amateurish. We were very friendly but real did not inspire confidence in anything they did. Our business manager looked like he should still be at school and had no sway at all. All in all not a serious business option.            
                I experienced some financial instability as a result of having the arrival of our first child and could I rely on my bank to help me in my hour of need . . . fat chance!My outgoings were pretty even every month and I rarely used my debit card for extra spending. However, having exceeded my overdraught (a situation which hadnât bothered HSBC for 9 months previously) they started bouncing direct debits (only one per month). They were charging me Â£150 every month and then surprised when I couldnât pay it back. My debt was therefore growing monthly due only to their MASSIVE charges. They wouldnât increase my overdraft and were not in the slightest bit interested in trying to help me resolve the distressing situation, just taking more and more money. My annual statement of charges totalled Â£1758 . . . which is staggering!! Iâd actually have been better off living purely from a credit card with a Â£3000 limit and not having a bank account.THEN, having sorted out my financial difficulties and decided to move banks (Jan 18th 2014) . . . 2 months AFTER the switch, I get a letter from HSBC demanding Â£25.89 on the account that had been closed for 2 months. Security questions when I rang them included âwhat did you last use your card for?â . . . I donât know that was over 2 months ago! And âwhats your Limit (assumed overdraft) . . . âresponseâ . . . what might it be now?â . . . I donât know, the account is closed, so zero?!I was informed that this amount is account charges because I didnât inform them that I was closing my account, never mind the fact that HSBC never told me I had to. My new bank handled that for me . . . for FREE!This followed by a threat that when further account charges get applied it would be nearly Â£50 . . . this sounded familiar! After lots of shouting, HSBC graciously zeroed the account and shut it.Itâs not a mistake; itâs another instance of legal but totally unethical banking practice . . . BE WARNEDBTW love the latest UK ad campaign . . we like to give you surprises! Yes you do!            
                I have been with HSBC for over 50 years.  My wife and I had an advanced current account and a regular saver account and a savings account. We decided after a couple of years that the advance account was not worth the Â£12.95 per month and decided to move to another bank for better benefits. Upon completion of the transfer(it took10 working days)HSBC took 2 months advance fee totalling Â£25.90 and reduced the regular savings interest from 6% to o.1% retrospective 11 months which I estimate was another Â£20 they had taken from us but all covered by very small print. Obviously 50 years with a bank carries no loyalty especially where money is concerned. Would advise all HSBC account holders to move to other banks but watch the small print and if you are thinking of joining, DON'T            
                My business account is with HSBC and my personal is with Natwest. I'm frequently astonished by how difficult it it to do pretty much anything with HSBC online. Today I had to change my online password, and I was required to print off, sign and fax (yes - fax!) a form to HSBC. They're stuck in the dark ages.I've had similar problems when it comes to downloading statements online (you're only able to download statements in the monthly format they send them to you), plus to set up bank feeds with my accountancy software provider I had to print and sign another form.  Put simply, they're stuck in the 20th century.            
                I moved to London a month ago from Washington, DC. I have an EU (Belgian) passport and thought that opening a bank account in the UK would be just as easy as it was in the US (took me 1 hour) or Belgium (1 hour, and I was not even a resident or citizen at the time application was made). I went to the HSBC Westminster branch because I saw that they offer tailored services for expats. The interview for opening the account lasted 2 hours, I was asked to provide copies of all my passports, details of ALL previous employers, details of all my assets abroad, and even what my bonus was last year. They said the decision on the account will be made by central office, and I will get a letter in 2 weeks informing of the decision. I received a refusal letter with no explanations of reasons. My credit record in the US and Belgium is impeccable, I was only trying to open a simple salary account with a debit card, they collected more information about me than the Belgian state has of me as its citizen, and all was a waste of time.I went to Barclays instead next door and had an account open in 1 hour. Do not believe that HSBC is for expats in London, this was the worst service I ever got in trying to open a bank account in any bank worldwide.            
                Been with the HSBC many years now. They're nothing staggering, and I've never found them particularly helpful, but they've never seriously let me down, either.            
                I changed to HSBC because we were travelling and I wanted a bank with international reach. I also invested through their PIMS product. The whole experience has been appalling and the complaint process has been even worse as they don't even meet their own stated complaints procedures or standards.Currently I have been charged whilst abroad using my debit card, HSBC have said that they are aware of he problem, but nobody seems prepared to do anything about it. How many HSBC customers are being charged 2.5% when they should not be!The PIMS investment has performed worse than any other investments that I have looked at and to take any money out from it you cannot use the HSBC secure online banking system!! You have to write them a letter, which is no use at all when you are in the amazon! The list of issues goes on and on, and sadly as I write having had my complaints escalated (my premier manager agreed with all the issues) I am still waiting for a proper response having raised the matter in early December. Their own policy promises to keep you informed!!I have never experienced such terrible service nor such a lack of interest , I will update when and if I actually get some professional response.            
                My partner is English and I am originally Iranian and we decided to open a joint account in Reading where we live together but after having need to wait and book an appointment for three weeks later, the woman told us that because I am originally Iranian they cannot open a joint account for us. This is when my partner has been with this bank since he was born, we are both earning good money each month. We both have got great credits and I have been living in England for almost 6 years all very legally and have been Lloyds bank's customer from the beginning and I have had all my documents and residents permit for the next three years. How stupid and racist is that?!! She said there are sanction against your country and we cannot open a joint account with you. Therefore we just walked out and went to Lloyd's bank and guess what?! They opened a joint account for us in less than 20 minutes without having to wait or to book any appointment. HSBC is rubbish and very soon it with go down the toilet. Their attitude and their customer service is terrible and not acceptable at all. My partner and his parents are going to change their banks from HSBC to Lloyd's Bank after this and we are going to make sure that none of our friends, family, colleagues and people we knows is going to start or continue with their bank. 10 I satisfied and offended like us  will be enough to make this bank be bankrupt in the near future. I am a marketing consultant and I can predict that clearly however they are so narrow minded  and stupid on that bank that they cannot see that now but they have really badly underestimated  the power of word of mouth which will screw them finally big time in the near future for sure.            
                I hate HSBC. They have the worst customer experience that I have ever experienced. I can not think of one positive thing to say about HSBC. They have so many ridiculous security procedures that you will have a difficult time accessing your money or account. For example, to talk with someone over the phone about your account you need a specific password mailed to you. If you happen to move and don't receive this information and might forget the two different passwords they require to login online - you're fucked. When you call to get things corrected or even to close your account, they suck at this too. You are transferred to so many different departments that you will find yourself on the phone for at least 45 minutes if not longer. DO NOT USE THIS BANK.            
                Letter dated April 2003 from HSBC heralding "A Relationship Manager for all your needs".A new era. A turnkey financial service blah blah blahGreat, in principle except that this took seven (7) months for them to announce who this person would be.So who was in "control" in those 7 months - no-one until I threw my bricks out the pram.I then get a Relationship Manager who seems OK and I spend considerable time with him over some quite complex matters only to discover on Linkedin that in January he no longer works for HSBC.Hardly prodessional, especially as HSBC talk about Relationships but clearly fail to understand what that actually means.No-one tells me, I have no idea who is now my "Relationship Manager" and what's happening over recommendations they are supossedly making.You then get other notices from them.Here's a good one, "you're Savings Account will now drop to 0.10%".Very unappealing verging on insulting.So I try and see what they can do ... 4 weeeks later no suggestions made.HSBC really have the the "customer" plot.There are BLOGS out there that rip them to shreds so HSBC should take note and address consumer concerns.That little girl (who has the lemonade stand in their ads) seems to be more dialled into what consumers want than HSBC even though this was HSBC's creation!!            
                I run a profitable small business in Vancouver, BC and until recently, had a small business account with HSBC. I have never been overdrawn and have a considerable balance in the account, on which HSBC pays me no interest. I just received a letter stating "..we have recently completed a strategic review of our business banking services. The reason behind this review is to ensure we re focusing our resources on customers that will benefit the most from our expertise.As a result of this review, we have made the difficult decision to end our banking relationship with your business. We recognize this may be a disappointment as to enable you to make alternate banking arrangements, we will maintain your accounts with us for up to 60 days. As of March 28, 2014, you will be unable to conduct any further transactions using your HSBC business accounts and any cheques presented fro payment will be returned....."I will never do business with HSBC again and will go far and wide in my public criticism of their treatment of small businesses in BC. If I could give the company zero stars, I would have.            
                I've been with this bank for 3 years now and have always felt good about this bank as every time I had to contact customer services, or pop into branch, the staff were very nice, polite and seemed informed... I was happy to have HSBC account...Until today, when I noticed that Â£120 were taken off my account to ''Pay notified fees''. I called the customer service and they told me that's because of overdraft (which was Â£130 or so). Everything would seem fine, but one week ago I had a chat at their branch about overdrafts. The employee told me that I can reach an overdraft up to Â£300 and no fees will be added. And I can keep my debt for as long as I want and I won't have to pay anything.Unfortunately, it was a LIE, accidental or not, but it was. this person just tricked Â£120 pounds out of me! So I am left feeling betrayed and fooled... First thing that came to my head was... go to Barclays! But when I saw it's reviews, I was devastated... ARE THERE ANY FAIR AND TRUSTWORTHY BANKS LEFT???            
                A month down the line and I still haven't been able to open an account with HSBC. I thought it would be easy as I was already a customer but it seems the opposite. I need to prove my address even though I am already a customer, but I can't use an HSBC statement. Customer service takes at least 20 minutes to get through to and when you do they don't care or have a clue. The woman told me I needed to bring a proof of address even though I had been into the branch with my passport, driving license, amex statement and tenancy agreement. Only upon imploring her to check for a THIRD time did she eventually realize the relevant documents were all there. I'm nearly there now but tempted to call the whole thing off and find a Bank that actually wants my business.            
                HSBC are by far the biggest con artists in the financial industry. Please please take not of all these reviews.. THEY ARE TRUE!! THIS BANK WILL DO WHAT THEY CAN TO GET MORE MONEY OUT OF YOU!!!            
                Customer service uninformed. Rang the business line and asked for everything i needed to open a community account. The first thing the banker with who I made an appointment with told me she was sorry she couldn't open an account as I didn't have a second signatory. I informed her that I had called the business line and asked what I needed to bring.. She was unapologetic. She then interrogated me like I was a criminal and insisted that I bring her my Barclays account statements even though I have three accounts with HSBC! Having spoken to a lawyer about the way she spoke to me, the lawyer said it sounded like the questions she was asking were indeed going down the criminal nature route.Went to Barclays instead and received excellent customer service.Opened a community account and it's happy days.            
                Was gonna open an account with them. booked an appointment over the phone. the call took half an hour because they wanted to setup my profile over the phone. when i show up for the appointment bringing ALL the papers they told me to bring they won't open the account anyways. says they need more papers and that these papers may or may not be accepted on a discretionary basis. wtf?! wen't around the corner to co-op and opened an account immediately with the papers i had.            
                1. I went to the branch I knew and to my surprise is closed.2. I googled another branch local number and I got forwarded to the same useless automated answering voice machine.3. I literally had to take a taxi through out the city to find a branch.4. I find a branch and when I explained that the phone number in the back of my HSBC credit card does not work, I am told there is nothing (NOTHING) the branch can do and that I just have to knock myself out continuing to call the number I've been dialing fro over a month trying to speak to someone to no avail.5. I filed a written complaint on their website 3 weeks ago and the problem has not been fixed.6. I tried calling the collect call "out of country" number and I also get hanged up on that one after dialing the full account number, social security and all information asked only to get the call disconnect on its own before even getting to a representative.7. I tried calling the HSBC debit card number and after 20 minute wait time, I explained my problem, I ask them to please report the phone number troubleshoot and I ask that they help me and to please not to place me on the automated voice again and it hangs up. And what does the rep do? he connects me back to the automated machine that hangs up!8. I go to another branch, explain my problem. They mark a phone for me from the branch and I wait 30 minutes before I get to talk to someone. I explain that I have been trying to reach someone for over a month, that I have been at the hospital, that I've had to medical emergencies and literally just got out of the hospital last Friday. Only to have the rep tell me I have to give him $1000. today. Seriously? I tell him that I am calling to discuss the programs that they may have and ask that some of the penalties be revoked considering they have been unreachable and the guy proceeds to give me the "recorder option" answer of saying the same helpless answer over and over and over again no matter how I re-frame the problem.9. And then when I finally speak to a supervisor and a solution emerges, the phone gets passed to customer service again and we are back in square one.Very saddened by this unnerving experience. They are speedily loosing my trust.            
                Just about to complete my second year as a business customer with HSBC, and I have found their service more than acceptable. The branches are plentiful in my area, and the staff are very easy to deal with. Cash withdrawals are easy and the downloadable PDF statements and manual transaction data exports work flawlessly. There are a few negatives. Charges for cash deposits are a bit of a joke, and use of cashpoints to withdraw cash can be pricey, but as my company is Limited and does most of its business online, that is not such a big deal. The account can allegedly be synced with my Freeagent accounting software, but I've never got this to work satisfactorily and I have reasonable IT skills. The security required to log in, by using a password-generating keyring widget can be a bit irritating, but if it makes my account more secure then I am happy to put up with it.I don't use an overdraft or borrow from HSBC for business, I don't have a chequebook and I gave back their business credit card, but if your company just wants a simple, easy-to-use banking service with good personal service, ample branches available and handy extras on the side like electronic cheque lodgements, then HSBC is a bank I would recommend.            
                I opened up a Passport Account last year because I'm from the Netherlands and no other bank would take me. This is a more basic than basic account, but you pay Â£8 a month. I do understand this as they need English proofs of address (utility bills) but in order to get those I needed an English bank account. Now, HSBC wanted to take me as a customer. I was happy to finally have a place to put my salary in. But what a nightmare it was..I opened up the account at my first appointment. The lady was nice, but apparently not very knowledgable. I gave her a pay slip, my passport and my Dutch proof of address. All good, account opened, I got my pin and card about 2 weeks later. I activated it, and guess what. Card blocked. So I had 2 months worth of salary on that account, and I couldn't access it. Went back, saying my card didn't work. Apparently the needed another proof of employment (I already gave them a sodding payslip) and another type of ID. It's embarassing to ask your boss to write the bank a letter proofing I've got a job. Luckily I also had an ID card, which was thankfully accepted as it's accepted nowhere in England.It took them 2 weeks to reopen my account, after I called them to ask if they finally fixed it. Customer service over the phone is alright, I think, but their accents are all pretty much untranslatable. I had to give them my email address, which I spelled out really clear, using the English phonetic alphabet, and they still got it wrong. I later found out that it was completely different from what I was saying to them.Also, my card gets blocked all the time, sometimes from online shopping, but even from a simple visit to Sainsburys or Co-op (where I go every day anyway). But when I went abroad a couple of weeks ago and forgot to notify HSBC my card was still working when I got back in England. Right.I've got an appointment standing to open up a current account with a building society, where I've already got a joined account with my partner.            
                I have been banking with them over the last 10 weeks and i must admit that there are one of the best banks i have ever dealt with. Great customer service and always making sure that you are satisfied with the level of service you received. I really do not understand why there are so many negative feedback.            
                I've been trying to open a student account in HSBC bank since my parents already had their accounts with them.The first problem that occured is that they needed proof of my address and didnt want to accept anything but tax bills. As a full time student I dont work and dont pay any tax bills so it was stupid to ask my parents to put me on a tax bill.Eventually I was able to proof my address when I got my UCAS letter. The bad things started to happen from that point.They called me to come to one of their branches and interviewed me there for more than an hours, asking stuoind or too private questions. For instance they started asking how much money exactly my parents intend to put to my account each month and each year. Honestly, how should I know? It's not like I am getting a salary. Then thay asked if I had any property abroad and how much it costs (why is this even televant to my student account?!).Eventually, they said that they have to send my details somewhere and I have to wait for an answer. After around 2 weeks I got I rejection to open studen account. It happened because I said that I probalby will be getting some money from Russia from my father...and they said that they will only consider opening my account only if I provide all financial information about my father (with who I dont even live together).As someone already said here they treat you like a criminal and make lots of problems for you. And they want to know everything about your finances. Honestly what if a lover is going to put money on my account???!!!Moreover, on the day that I went to the branch there was a scandal because some woman had 2000 pounds on her HSBC account and suddendly they dissapeard due to some mistake that HSBC made (or maybe they stole it, I dont know) and HSBC didnt even want to do anything about it.So I strongly advice anyone not to go there            
                They have treated me like some thief twice already even though I never had overdrafts, loans or mortgages with them. They refused to offer me a student account because of 'bad banking conduct' to which I replied in shock and the advisor simply said to me 'Oh don't pretend you don't know' Apparently it was about a direct debit which caused me to go Â£3 in overdraft, which they initially said to me would be impossible as I had no available overdraft. While on a gap year I had two direct debits bounce after which I got back in touch with them to reinstate the direct debit of my phone contract. I specifically told them enough money was in the account and that they should not close my account. The customer services representative told me that everything was ok and that they were not going to close my account. Two months later in Brazil, my bank account had been closed! With a remaining balance of Â£90 in my account! They simply don't care, if you're not rich, they don't want you. Now I tried to open an account again, and they refused to offer me anything, as if I had stolen money from them. Good riddance!!            
                HSBC has by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  After keeping me on hold for over an hour a am greeted by an incompetent service rep. who clearly has no idea what he is doing.  I could not be happier that I switched all my banking to Chase.  Do NOT bank with HSBC!!!!!            
                This is the worst bank in entire India ,.... I am highly disgusted by their services...There is like endless things .....1) Once I lost my wallet ... I had like 5 cards of different banks ... For rest of the banks, It took me 10 mins to stop transactions ... With HSBC , they took an hr .. thank god ... there were no transactions on my account ... otherwise I would have sued the bank...2) It was a pain getting a new card issued from the bank ... If it would have not been my salary account , I would have closed it long time back ...3) They never send me bank statement or message on debits despite my calling up 1000 times and asking for the same.4 ) Now they sent a new card bcoz they want to increase security and all ..... I nvr received msg from the bank ... got a call from courier company .... I was little shocked ... I nvr asked for card ..... As per courier guy, I was not at my place ... so it went back to hsbc banl ...then I called up bank 10 times to ask where the card is right now .... No response ....waited for 15 times every time (please note their number is not toll free like other banks)I sent an email .... telling complaints .... no one cared to call back ....I am highly disappointed with the services... Never open an account with HSBC .... its not customer service .... but customer harrassment ....            
                Can I just start by saying I bank with Barclays, always have and I have never ever faulted them with anything, their actually amazing compared to HSBC.So I've been looking into loans as I'm wanting to have surgery, and i found online that HSBC do the best deal with their interest rates, however Barclays will match ANY other quote and then give you Â£50. Great! I was told by my Barclays advisor in personal banking that all I need to do is pop into HSBC and get them to print out the online quote for me, bring it back then it's mine. Well.. It wasn't that easy.After searching for a branch in the pouring rain in busy Manchester city centre I finally find a branch, I was relieved after being soaked. I walked in expecting to see friendly faces like in Barclays but oh no. There was no one stood around to help! I had no idea where to go when finally I caught eye contact with an elderly advisor across the room, she looked grumpy to say the least.  I asked her if there was someone I could speak to and all I literally got back was 'no'. What!!!! How rude!! When I asked why I got told in a snotty voice 'there's no one free to see you at all today, make an appointment next time' I couldn't believe it!! I told her all I needed was someone to print out the online quote for me, something she could of done herself! And still I got a no. I couldn't believe how rude she was and I has to cancel my appointment to go back to see Barclays. Infanct you don't NEED an appointment to see someone in Barclays that's what's so shocking about HSBC!!!! So I went outside and googled for another near branch and thought I'd ring first to make sure, only to find they straight away ask for your HSBC card number to be entered...what the hell!?!? Then when I did nothing it didn't even put me through to the branch it put me through to Scotland!! And he wanted to set up a current account with me before i speak to someone which I refuse to do, why should I? I told the man (nearly on the verge of going crazy) that all I need is a quote, and after all my efforts he turned around and said 'no sorry, we won't quote you without having a current account'I was angry.Sad thing is if I went in, sat down and spoke to someone nice who told me this in the first place, I may have actually switched to HSBC current account to get the loan!!! So glad i didn't, especially after reading these reviews.All I can say is go to Barclays. They look after you and are smiley and you can go in and speak to someone in personal banking anytime!            
                One year later, two lost houses later, Â£Â£Â£ in wasted phone calls and recorded delivery costs the underwriter finally contacted me yesterday to tell me the decision in principle issued by HSBC was wrong (delivered in a manner suggesting this error is somehow my fault) all couched in extremely xenophobic terms. If your name sounds 'foreign' (their words, not mine) walk away.  Now, I'm told my original documents are lost by the bank (again as though this is somehow my fault). The bank will abuse you in every way possible save for actual physical assault. For goodness sake, don't waste your time, energy and goodwill. Banks are bad, but not this bad. We were only applying for 36% LTV as Premier customers and still untold misery ensued.....Oh and by the way, don't bother writing to the MD/CEO as his department doesn't bother responding to correspondence. Is First Direct really a subsidiary of HSBC? How can it be any better. Notwithstanding those rave reviews and tempting switching fees, I will never touch an HSBC related company again. If there was a zero star option that would have been generous.            
                I first joined HSBC when I started High School as they had a scheme where they were trying to introduce us to banking. I wish I hadn't bothered. Since starting University I have had countless incidents with this bank and considering I am on a "Student Account" I am convinced some of these things shouldn't have occurred. So, when asked if I needed an overdraft I said yes, presuming the bank was there to help me through, what is of course, a tough three years money-wise. Like most students I have to pay rent and bills as well as trying to support myself, whilst on a part-time wage, I didn't want to ask my parents as I saw this was a time to prove myself and begin to look after myself. Well finding out I was going to fall short on my rent HSBC refused to let me extend my overdraft! I wasn't over it either or at my limit, I still had at least Â£600 I should of been allowed to extend it by. Not only that but then I was lectured by someone who was very hard to hear and understand on a phone about my credit rating! This is the last thing I need to think about when I'm struggling to buy food! I have also researched that students shouldn't receive credit rating whilst still in full-time education.  The service is very poor, they harass you with calls and stupid times and when you do answer them the people are not helpful in the slightest. Especially with this being a student account I expected a lot more help but instead I am allowed to go over my overdraft and I am then charged! How is this fair and right? The whole point of an overdraft is so you can't exceed that particular amount! Its a huge scam and if you are a student or anyone for that matter....avoid this bank at all costs, they are unreliable, rude and 100% detached from their client. They should enquire about that persons life, not in an intruding way but in a way that could shape their account needs around them. This is the worse bank I have ever experienced and judging by the other reviews I am not the only one that thinks this! I have now started an account with another bank and already I am beginning to realise how truly terrible HSBC are.            
                I could have died, because of hsbc!!!! 2 weeks, before our trip to USA, me&my boyfriend went to our branch and  told them, that we are going abroad. Lady from hsbc told me, that there`s really cheap shoes and clothes, so i took a credit card. If not the credit card - we really would have died there, we been in the middle of the desert, and - TADAAAA - our bank accounts are closed. WHAT THE HELL ????? nobody even called us!!!!!!!! I tried to get in touch with my bank, but i couldn`t, i tried every single phone number!! finally, when i contact them thru e-mail, they call back, and despite the fact, that i answered everything about me, my address and explained a situation, that i can`t even top up, because of that FU*KING BANK, but all they said - you need to answer a number of questions, so we know.. and then my credit ended.  When we got back home, our branch just told us - oh, sorry. that`s unusual. !!!!! i was (and still am) really, really upset. HOW THE HELL THAT HAPPEN?!!! They don`t care about people at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            
                Blocking cards when trying to use them abroad, if you haven't given them their travel plans. Very xenophobic - World's *local* bank.But that applies to all UK banks. I'll stick to my cards from my home country for travel.            
                It has taken me over 8 weeks to open a basic account with HSBC, in spite of them telling me that I was able to do so with no problem. They have sent things to the incorrect address, lied to me about what was going on with my application, haven't given me the correct information at any time and I have spent at least 8 hours total on the phone with them trying to get access to  just one basic bank account. They lost the paperwork twice, in spite of having reference numbers all over it and I had to go back into a branch and fill out everything all over again. Then absolutely nothing got done for 2 more weeks until I phoned and asked them. It was just sitting there unprocessed apparently. I had to leave the country before they sent out the token used to access my account online, so they promised they would send it to a home address so my friend could send it on to me. Instead, I phone them again weeks later to find out they sent it to the branch and were expecting me to go and pick it up. In spite of repeated requests, they then sent it to the branch again. So I still cannot access my own account online, after 8 weeks of being lied to and given the run around. Every single thing they have promised to do has not been done. They then treat you like you should be grateful every time you phone and have to wait 20 minutes to speak to someone and each individual person believes they are 'helping you out' to some extreme degree when it is their JOB to actually get this stuff done. Would I ever use HSBC again? Not on your life. I'm Australian, I do business in 3 major countries and I have never had such a poor customer service experience with any bank.            
                Having been a business customer of this "bank" for ten years the service has now deteriorated to the point where we simply have to switch banks or go under. Whilst branch counter staff attempt to be helpful, the chain of command defeats all their efforts.  Setting up new accounts take for ever. Closing old accounts can be a lottery which has to be attempted several times to get it right.  Ever eager to supply credit cards, these often fail to work, resulting in tedious phone calls to their  useless overseas call centre.No bank is perfect.  HSBC however scores a perfect zero.  A shame trustpilot forced me to award a single star, which they do not deserve.            
                Now, time for a rant about HSBC.  For those of us who have accounts with these guys, I lend my sympathy.  For anyone who does not have an account with them, don't.  There has been a long litany of trying to get them to do something that I won't go into now, but the latest is beyond belief.  The bank has instituted this security device thing that you need to do certain on-line transactions, like wire transfers, etc.  I have one of these for Sri Lanka, but each country has its own.  So I order one for Canada.  They assure me that it will be sent by courier.  That was exactly one month ago, and still no device.After 3 weeks, I phone them only to find out that the computer did not make the request because my address is outside of Canada.  Of course, no follow up by the bank.  Nothing would have been done if I had not called again.  This time, they assure me that the thing will reach me in a few days by express courier.  One week later, and still nothing.I call again.  This time, I am ready to rip someone's throat out.  They don't know anything again.  I ask to speak to a supervisor.  There are none on duty.  Then through the conversation and reference to times of day, I discover that although I am calling a number I think is in Toronto, I actually have someone in Malaysia.  I demand to speak to a Canadian agent, who eventually calls me back after an hour.  She is very polite, but knows nothing either.  She is trying to get the tracking number which as I write, she still has not succeeded in doing.In desperation, I emailed the branch in Nanaimo where I hold my account.  They were very helpful and said they would send out a device immediately, but who know when that will arrive.  Meanwhile, here I sit unable to do the banking I need.  It was easier 30 years ago, when all you had do was send a fax.They call this a global banking system.  They should be ashamed.            
                I've been banking with this company over 10 years. I have a good job, but due to the fact that my husband lost his business during financial crisis, we started to experience some money constraints.Both of us have  secure jobs and needed a loan to support my studies. HSBC totally refused me, despite the fact that my repayments after paying off the previous loan are going to be Â£30 a month more.Two years ago they showered us with letter offering anything we want  and now- totally opposite. Interesting, the banks kill the economy, get taxpayers money and punish us for not being able to meet their standards. What about meeting ours?Disgusting.            
                I've been with HSBC for a while and really never needed anything, I was premier account.The customer service is barely understandable and unuseful.When I call to advise about traveling, in order to use my debit and credit card (I call both, bank and credit card c.s.) the cards never work and have to call again.Today I saw a weird movement in my account and after the long process through the automatic voice mail, I ended up to talk to a heavy indian accent guy who told me to call again tomorrow because he doesn't know the reason.Frustrating and over all poor service for an over charging bank.Will bring my business somewhere else            
                I think there a nice branch and help full barclays are shit my branch in islington are nice in angel especially Chelsea one of the lovelyest  employees ever            
                I have accounts at Natwest (excellent) and Barclays (not bad, but it's just an online savings account so my needs are minimal). My wife and I decided to open a household account and mortgage at HSBC because of their reputation and their global presence. A huge mistake!We were given a Premier account because of our mortgage and salaries, and we were therefore expecting special treatment - another mistake.Customer service is very poor. The branches are designed to feel like shops, with music playing and staff standing around. Sadly most of these staff are useless and generally unable to actually do anything for you. In most small branches there is no distinction made for premier customers, so my view is that there's no point having this status - just seems like a gimmick to make you feel good. Sadly it has the opposite effect because you expect special treatment, although what you get is service that's worse than basic service at other banks. I took out a small loan last year, with the expectation of paying it off early. Since May I have been trying to pay it off but it's impossible to do this even though it's allowed under the terms of the loan. It started when I received my annual loan statement, which advised that I should write to HSBC if I wanted to pay off the loan early. Unfortunately the letter did not say who or where to write to. I don't have an actual branch, just a PO box somewhere, because I opened the account online. So I called HSBC using the number on my debit card. I was asked to enter my telephone banking PIN before I could speak to anyone, although I don't use phone banking. Therefore I didn't have a PIN. After several messages saying that my account would be frozen if I hung up, I  finally got through to a call centre (thankfully in the UK). I explained the situation to the operator who wasn't sure who I should write to. She put me on hold to discuss with her colleagues. After a few minutes she came back to say that they didn't know who I should write to!! She also said that I could pay off my loan over the phone - so the statement I received was both incorrect and misleading. They also advised that I could go to any HSBC branch to pay off my loan. This morning I went to my local branch, only to be told that because they are such a small branch (indeed they described themselves as a 'counter', rather than a branch), they had nobody trained to discuss loans!! And this is one of the world's largest banks!  All i want to do is pay them some money and close my loan down, for me this is a very basic banking transaction that any branch should be able to process. They advised that I go to a larger branch, and waste even more of my time. To recap, the letter I received was wrong, the advice given by the call centre was wrong, and the experience in this branch was very poor. I had a second issue to sort out as well. My wife's debit card on our joint account is no longer accepted in shops or online, and we don't know why. I took the card in and showed it to them. According to their systems, the card was fine! Their advice was to try using it in an ATM and see what happens. Thanks! HSBC hides behind bureaucracy and processes, and doesn't allow its staff to help customers. They are not in the least bit interested in helping customers sort out issues, and staff just pass you from one person to another, with nobody actually doing anything useful. They just follow their own rules and processes, and to hell with the customer. In 30 years of using banks, this has been my worst experience ever. Ultimately my wife and I have decided to move our accounts to Natwest, where we have both had much better experiences - staff there actually solve your problems. Staff at HSBC just create problems.I would advise anyone not to open an account at HSBC - even a basic account at other banks will provide you with better service.            
                I've been busy looking after both myerly parents and as I'm self employed this has hit hard - I forgot my Equity Union fees were going out of my account and went Â£1.96 overdrawn.  Just opened a statement with a notification that I will be charged Â£112 charges for going overdrawn!!!  What a rip off!  Seeing as I have little money coming in that account I will obviously go overdrawn again and so expect I'll get another clobbering to the tune of Â£112.  What a disgusting rip off practice.  Many friends and family warned me about the terrible reputation of this global fat cat company - I really should have listened!This review site want a star ratting but won't let me give no stars - or a minus star reveiw, lol!This review site could do with a minus star rating, lol!            
                Have been with the Bank for over 20 years as what they call a Premium customer. Very occasionally I have not been 100% impressed with them, but I would say that generally they are a very competent outfit. Their website works very well. Last year I opened a business account and so far everything has gone well. (They called me back when I registered my interest in a business account. Lloyds TSB and Nat West did not bother to return my calls.) The only situations where I have not been impressed is when I have encountered a member of staff who 1.) is not fully aware of what can or cannot be done, 2.) needs training in how to deal with the public or 3.) is in a call centre in India and talks to me like I am an imbecile. In general the staff I deal with in the UK are polite, helpful and diligent.            
                I banked with these crooks for around 20 years, little did I know they were shifting money for drug cartels in South America. I closed my accounts yesterday, as I walked into the York branch there was 3 employees stood in the main foyer just chatting, holding there so important clip boards. No thanks HSBC not anymore, I'm not paying into your bull s*** anymore.            
                I visited the branch inArgyle Street today.  What a terrible service. All I wanted to pay was some bills that had to be paid into this bank.  They have loud music blasting.  A lot of Employees walking around with bottles of water in their hands chatting to each other.  Had to wait in queue for over 40 minuets even though only a few customers were in the queue.  Thank God I don't have a account in this branch.            
                All I have to say, I was recently scammed about Â£600 from a con artist (who is in prison now by the way). When this happened, I asked them for advice on what to do, and on the lovely outsourced to India phone line to which I couldn't understand a single word of what the operator was saying "This is YOUR fault, you need to sort this out YOURSELF, since you paid with a bank transfer, we can't offer you anything".I was nothing but nice, and kind about this, I asked them if there was anything I could do, reporting it to whoever, contacting the bank the money went to, what exactly could I do in my situation "Work it out for yourself, it's your fault you lost your money" is what I was told over and over again. Well, congratulations you utter pricks, you've now lost a user of 5 years, and I recently set up a business account to which will be closed very soon :) all I did was ask for advice, not for my money back, learn to listen.Stop outsourcing to illiterate and ill-spoken Indian call centres, it's ridiculous. That just added insult to injury.            
                I've had the misfortune of dealing with HSBC for many years and once in a blue moon, when you ring them, you'll get through to a call centre in the UK and you might find your call is dealt with satisfactorily.Unfortunately the majority of the time your call/web note/email ends up being dealt with in some third world backwater by people who couldn't give a stuff about your enquiry. It's almost like they know they're having to deal with your request because HSBC are misers and not because they have anything that could be remotely interpreted as people skills.            
                This is a pathetic bank providing a pathetic service to costumers. Honestly, how can we trust a call from someone speaking as fast as they can with an accent only they understand, on a Saturday (!) prompting you to confirm all your card details to them? I can hardly believe HSBC contacts their costumers this way, but yes, they do. To top it off, this is the 3rd or 4th time within a year that my card is blocked due to "suspicious transactions" (such as Â£20 cash withdrawals in the shopping centre, Â£16 payment to Abel & Cole - suspicious indeed!) and I am told that my card has been cloned.  So, what's all that "security" about? The 3 passwords, numbers and the tacky calculator? For a guy to call you from wherever and tell you that your card has been cloned AGAIN? The "excellent" costumer service have offered me a new card, but I've had bad experiences the other many times my card was blocked and cloned and I don't know what else. HSBC sent one of the cards to another address once, on another occasion they 'forgot about it' and I had to call and remind them it had been 15 days I was waiting for my card and then when they did, the card was broken right on the magnetic strip (I think they have a strange sense of humour there). I'm fed up. It's been long 3 years and it's high time I had gone banking somewhere else. That's what I'm doing right now.            
                Now I don't true them. This Mexican scandal is incredible. I thought they were the last trustworthy bank in the world...Thieves... breaking the whole system down.            
                I've been with HSBC since it was Midland Bank PLC! It was where my Dad took me to open my first bank account when I was just a child.At the beginning of June I was able to successfully log into my current account via the online portal they have. No problems.... come the end of the Month, my online access is no longer in place. Several failed attempts to access my account resulted in the account becoming blocked. So I've called the Customer Services and the person on the end of the phone can't tell me why my account is no longer accessible online. She can see there has been an instruction to remove the service.... but it didn't come from ME - the account holder, and just so you know, I run a pretty good account! Anyway, I'm given the option to go into a branch to pick up one of their security devices to access the online service or have it sent out to me. OK, but still doesn't answer the question - Why was my access removed in the first place. I await the response from their "investigations team". Not impressed.            
                My experience suggests that after years of good relationship with a Premier account holding, the final outcome has been disastrous on changing to a new branch.It continued with a litany of errors for years without my knowledge only to be discovered by accident. It admits its mistake and failing in its customer charter but refuses to return my money sent to a third party through negligence. Even the third party has refunded a portion that is permissible within the statutory limits. All that HSBC provides is verbal diarrhoea. It has been one and a half years now. I live overseas and planning a trip to the UK so that I can sue the bank  for refusing to return my money with interest, all costs as well as loss of income due to attendance.            
                Been with HSBC 20+ years now and would love to give them 5 stars but over the years i have a few issues though they have got sorted eventually. But saying that they have looked after me when i've needed a loan or two. I would love to have everything handled by HSBC like mortgage, insurances but there just slightly of the competitive side of things, fingers crossed for the future            
                After taking financial strain we called HSBC for help. They declined. Then we called some months later to sort out a payment plan. They declined. All the while we were being charged over draft fees and interest. In the last 12 months we have paid over Â£2000 which if we hadn't paid we wouldn't been in the financial situation we now are in. I feel it is disgusting that we are expected to pay the charges but when we are transparent about our predicament and ask for help we are told no. They were not willing to help except send us to a debt management website. The website suggested we ask the bank for a payment plan. ..... Which we had already done. Ironic. HSBC are brilliant to start. I see why they could post a Â£11 billion pre-tax profit. They abuse their customers!            
                I find the HSBC website the easiest of the banks to use for onilne banking.  Having moved from Natwest and from using Barclays for my business banking I can say I find HSBC without doubt the easiest of the major banks and the one offering most online support if you need it.            
                Ordered a new bank card as mine snapped recieved it 3 days later in the post was awaiting a new pin to come which never did after ringing them i found out I wouldn't recieve a new one. Which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand.Very hard to understand anyone as they seem to be located everywhere but england!Still have not be able to sort out an issue with the ammount i caan withdraw per day either. Been 'sent' out forms that have never arrived.            
                Can't understand a word they mumble. They talk over you. Rude. Very rude. And now their internet banking requires you to carry with you a tacky kiddie calculator to gain access, made in china and works for a few minutes before dying, that's if it even turns on in the first place. Ask them to revert back to the non-secure key era as they have alienated so many customers with it and their answer is "since you have made a complaint regarding the secure key we will be de-activating your access to the service within 60 days". Well done the Listening Bank that was - now deaf! Glad to leave you.            
                HSBC bankUsed to be the best bank in the world when I was a student.  After 3 Â£150 charges I nolonger bank with them.  The branches are always closed, the customer services are Indian (so I can understand nothing they say)  The charges are unexplained and exceptionally high.  Poor service all round.            
                My son has an account with them. When they allowed him to accidentally overdraw they charged him heavily. He applied for an overdraft facility and they turned him down. His charges total Â£225 for a six week period. He is a student with a part time job earning around Â£200 per month. How can he be expected to get out of that trap while they charge him more than half of his monthly earnings in charges? He is now dead against ever doing business with HSBC once he is in full time employment.            
                HSBC has provided banking that is to be expected. You want a place to store your finances, have access, and easy management for payments etc. They do all that and also the couple times I called up their Customer services were hassle free, got through to and Advisor in a decent amount of time, they were helpful and had very good product knowledge. I have heard of other banks customer service as utter nightmares, but it has been good here, and I don't dread having to call up if I need to!            
                HSBC is a bank that cares about their customers. They are committed to your growth.            
                Online banking is second to none (don't like the new secure token you have to carry around with you but that is life I suppose).Rarely have a problem with them and their Â£12 a month advance account is great value (inc. breakdown cover and travel insurance).Would recommend.            
                they closed my account without any reason, I requested to transfer my ISA to another bank, but they just closed the account. Also charged me Â£190 for early withdrawal of the saving account(by their decision).Also HSBC online banking is not safe, they do not use safe device, which caused lots of accounts hacked.            
                spent a great deal of my life talking to indians like greg who in the end cannot help you and transfer you. STOP USING INDIAN CALL CENTRES, ALL YOU DO IS WING US UP!            
                after spending over 30 mins with someone in the bank and taking all my details down and advising of previous address etc, i get a letter in the post to give the same info again - called up (no option for new customers without bank details) to complain told to call back another day as branch now closed. delaying the whole process in setting up the account. seeing there ads on tv and the real service you get is somewhat different. week 2 and still waiting for confirmation on my new account to be set up. think i will be banking elsewhere in the long run as a result.            
                15 years I have been with them.  THEY locked me out of my account and over drew me, I got a Â£150 charge - which they refuse to refund.  ALl the operators are in India - can hardly speak English, a disgrace!

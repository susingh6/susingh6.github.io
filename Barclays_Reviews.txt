                Useless absolute useless. Though their profits indicate differently. Four times I was redirected today between various branches. All had the same glum I don't care/give a crap about your interest.But who is better?            
                A year or two ago, they replaced all the counters at my local branch, bar one, with ATMs.  I like to use the counter, but with only one left, it can take up to 30 mins to be served.  The bank's staff know what I think.  So what do they do?  They all empathise (probably been on a course) and ignore me.  One tried to sell me something when I complained about receiving unsolicited phone calls.  Today, the person who I think might be their branch manager, told me off for upsetting a customer.   I do not think they accept the bank's changes are root cause of my unhappiness.  I have been a customer for this lot for 40 years, but given they way they behave, you would not know it.  If you are thinking of setting up an account, give this bunch of oiks a wide berth.  Dreadful place.            
                I am very disappointment.i am  three times failed with access Authoritarian.when i use online any booking activities or booking etc. I feel think about change different new  bank comapny because  I am aware because i  understand to pay 16 pound for  staff responisble thier Barclays. I went face to face staff > They had been phoned direct over sort out with Authoritarin . when i going home . Still failed  access.I unable phone. i am deaf person.            
                They have made an error with my mortgage. Can't get through to speak to someone. Messaging system pointless as some idiot keeps avoiding answering my question. Problem still not resolved. I will NEVER EVER use Barclays again. Absolutely appalling customer service!            
                I opened 2 savings accounts with Barclays. I can access neither of them from an app ("because you don't have a current account") and their online system is a nightmare labyrinth of passwords, passcodes, keys and useless assistants. One account was a help to buy isa, so when the time came I needed to close it and get a statement and letter.... "Sorry we'll have to send it to you in the post" (Halifax can print it immediately). then I needed to transfer a rather modest house deposit from the other account. You'd think you can do it online and confirm/authorise over the phone. But no no no no. You have to come into branch. I'd say for the £2 extra interest I earnt on the accounts over what their rivals would have given me has absolutely not been worth it. I highly recommend you avoid and look for more convenient ways to bank in the 21st century. However if getting your statements on 90s computer systems and stone tablets is your thing then knock yourselves out....            
                Most disgusting behaviour from this Bank! Does not help people at all and just charge stupid amounts of interest for their own benefit.            
                Barclays will be loosing a loyal customer. Had money go out of my bank today to someone who I do not even know and have no direct debits on my account so I don't know how this has been allowed. Rang the fraud team and told to wait 10 days for the money to be claimed by who's tried to take it out of my bank and then they can do something so now bills have to wait another 10 days maybe more to be paid and all because they have allowed someone who I don't know to take money out of my bank with no explanation of who they are or how they managed to get my bank details as I don't do anything online with my card!! Fraud team we're not very helpful as this happened 4 weeks ago and I was what I thought reassured that this will be stopped but no 4 weeks later and they have allowed this to happen again. No apologies or anything. Once this is sorted I will not be banking with them again. 😡😡😡😡            
                Barclays are closing all the smaller branches in the area. Have to go to the bigger branch in the town centre pay to park and then walk 500 metres to the branch carrying money to pay in. If I need change for my shop it means carrying a heavy bag back and in full view for all to see. They say the smaller branches are closing because they are not used enough which is total rubbish as my local branch has queues outside the door constantly.            
                I had a problem with my debit card and had to ring Barclays to sort it, no apology about having to take time out of my schedule, nor responsibility on their part for the issue. Waste of time.            
                I took advantage of a free credit transfer to one of their cards. the first card was for some reason revoked; no explanation.A new card appears, so i think all is well.  I get a letter from my bank saying i have insufficient funds to pay the standing order to Barclays.I then find that the Idiots had set up a standing order for the TOTAL balance owing!I then had the most miserable task of trying to sort this out with their overseas call centre - After hours on the phone to several people with strong accents and on a desperately bad lines I thought it was sorted.NO it wasn't, I get letters saying I'm late with my payments!I then put in a complaint about their disgraceful ineptitude which was to be investigated,I finally get to talk with someone in the uk, she was - I thought, being helpful in resolving the problems, NOT. Today I get a letter saying that they are changing my interest free account to an interest payable account.So, now Im being punished for having the audacity to complain about their TOTAL ineptitude and lack of customer care.What a bunch of as*holes, I would complain to the banking ombudsman but as they are in the pockets of the banks it would hardly be worth the trouble.Do yourself a favavour;-STAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS CARTEL OF MORONS.            
                This is literally the worse credit card I've ever had...I refuse to waste even more time to enumerate the multiple reasons this card is a complete disaster. I've already wasted enough time dealing with the multiple errors the bank has made and their utter lack of competency.As soon as I finish resolving the latest debacle, I am closing my account. Good riddance!By the way the CEO of Barclay was just arrested for fraud....            
                Extremely helpful and courteous at all times.            
                Having stood in a queue for over 20 minutes in the Harlow branch of Barclays I do not think they have any concept of providing a service.            
                Online banking is OK - though very difficult to browse and amend debit plans. In branch - forget it!!  customer services is the worst I have experienced in years. Cashiers seem non existent and you are simply pointed to a banking computer that is hard to navigate. Or in my case referred to a phone which was hung on a wall in the branch to talk to customer services online. I then sat on a plastic chair next to the wall hung phone to be held for 20 mins then being past from dept to dept before being told that they were 'experiencing issues' and to call back!            
                Must be the worst bank out of the lot! Spend money, they lock your account. Go abroad, they lock your account. Ring them up to unlock your account, they don't unlock your account. Absolute joke. Phone line's are always some Indonesian that you cannot understand or be understood by. Don't even get me started on the Online banking what a p**s take that is!            
                i had a great experience with the customer service telephone team. They were friendly and excited to help me with my queries.            
                Barclays owe me over a thousand pounds due to over-payments, but have said they have no facility to repay this to me. I have contacted the financial ombudsman who seem  completely abysmal as well. The ombudsman have agreed that Barclays are in the wrong but are completely powerless when it comes to enforcement. We need a watchdog with teeth and 'brains' too - dealing with them is a real chore as you have to explain things multiple times and help them with their logic. - what recourse do we have for these 'wild-west' banking outlaws when they can do what-they-want-with-impunity ( except when criminal charges crop up from time-to-time  when they press their luck too far - as in the case of libor-fixing, energy-price-rigging and entering into deals where they shouldn't) - shocking and this is just a small part of what we know.The Barclays website link for financial crime makes me laugh- It's like a wolf talking about the merits of vegetarianism.            
                Same as others.   I went into the branch to move some money.  I was told my debit card was not showing up.  I showed ID.  They said they would sort it out.   A week later I called them.   Got cut off after 20 minutes as they transferred me.   Called back.  They said they would call me in 30 minutes.  No call.  I tried web chat.  It's public apparently, they cannot do anything and even kept asking the same questions and did not absorb the problem.   I now need to go back to the branch, with ID, again.   I am none the wiser why my valid debit card is not showing up on the account.    I am glad this is not my main account and if it wasn't a joint one with my Mother for ease of helping her, I would close it.   Barclays if you do read these reviews - you need to train your call centre staff better, stop them reading and repeating scripts and quite frankly sort out problems people have accessing their own money when your computers or operators have failed.            
                all i want is a debit card for my barclays account and i have made at least 100 calls from indonesia and spoken to 28 customer service officers who are all 'terribly sorry' but do absolutely nothing! they are suposed to courier a new card WITH pin and a pin sentry device, but every time only  one or two of the three arriveat a time....pathetic! they talk of asian countries being third  world,but i get first class service here!!wrote to the head of complaints who didnt bother to reply. I was in UK for 4 days and spent 3 days explaining my problem to various reatils outlest of barclays who empathised with me but couldnt do a thing!! writing to ent my frustration....            
                what a complete waste of time the indian call centres are, tried to cancel a payment I did online and change it to another date, while trying, a box popped up to tell me it can't be done at the moment and to phone the number displayed so I did and what a performance I had, went through the security procedure   explained what I wanted to do and was told it  can't be done I told the guy I just wanted to change the date from the 7th of the month back to the 3rd simple NO IT WASN'T I asked to be put through to an English call centre and again the clown said it can't be done after 25 mins of this clown who kept asking the same question and  talking  crap I put the phone down on him BARCLAYS GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER  do you not employ ENGLISH people anymore            
                I wanted to open a Barclays Smart Investor account, but needed a barclays current account first. So proceeded to set up a current account online, it was great asked me some questions and after about 15 minuites the current account was open. I thought it was great.So onto the Smart Investor site I went, used my user details to open the account, then was redirected to my current account where a box pops open a telling me I need Pinsentry activation for smart investor, so I click ok and the box disappears and nothing, no instructions, nothing but by current account details.So I go back to the Smart investor site and try logging in, I'm taken right back to my current account, so after a quick scan I try opening smart investor from my current account and am asked for a Pinsenty code which I dont have because I dont have a card reader. But it says if I use mobile banking then the Pinsentry app is on there. So I download Barclays Mobile banking app and I'm asked to register using the Pinsentry method, but I cant I dont have the device, but it say I can register Mobile banking by using an atm so of to town I go and register. Get home and try logging into Smart investor it askes my for my Pinsentry code, I open my mobile app and the friggin thing says I have to wait 10 days for the pinsentry to activate on my phone..What a bloody joke, BARCLAYS IS A LUMBERING DINOSAUR IN THE MODERN WORLD!!!!            
                I would have given zero stars but unfortunately, it's not an option!! In their wisdom, the company I work for decided to bank with Barclays. I've been in the queue in Bletchley now for over 10 minutes just to pay money in. There are more staff wandering around doing nothing than there are behind the counter. Really slow service. Bank elsewhere!!!            
                Not bad at all. Problems? Tell em firmly it will get sorted or compensated. Easy telephone transfer free number on that .All problems occured have been small and sorted out promptly.One off the better banks !            
                Ive been a Barclays account holder ever since they took over the Woolwich......recently i cancelled a direct debit to talk talk as i was changing to Sky....not only did they cancel that they also cancelled a direct debit i had with talkmobile...so unknown to me this resulted in a massive bill of £82.50 from £12.50....i had to call talkmobile to reset the standing order, the helpful customer service guy i spoke with also reduced the amount on the bill.....but it was still way higher than I'm used to....i contacted barclays via web chat to Vicky Saini who was aware that talk talk and talk mobile were different companies but couldn't do anything about their error....not even an apology .....im seriously considering changing banks as this is one of too many costly errors to count.            
                It's 2017. I try to transfer £25 to my daughter using pingit to get a cab. Pingit returns an error code of p2001. However the message on the screen advises me to call barclays on the customer service number, but reassuringly, I won't have to explain. ( yeah right  I believe that) but let's see...   Obviously the person who wrote the error code message hadn't spoken to the barclays customer service team as after 20 minutes, of explaining and 'going through security' the meaning of this generic code is that the transfer may not have worked and I should try again later! Wow, thank you to barclays for that explanation. I'll pass that information onto my daughter who had been waiting 20mins for the money to get a cab. Maybe Uber will use that reassurance that my daughter may be able to pay, but if she can't they should try again later.            
                Truly appalling service from Barclays.  We instructed them by letter to transfer £60,000 from our Savings Account to our Current Account before we issued a cheque for £50,000.  Before we wrote the cheque we checked with them that they had our transfer instruction.  The problem was they didn't action it and as a result we went overdrawn.  We have made several phone calls now to sort it out and were on the phone for over an hour yesterday.  First they said the letter hadn't been signed in accordance with the mandate.  I had a copy of the signed letter in front of me and could see that it had been signed as per the mandate.  I insisted on this point and then they went away and then came back and said that the reason the transfer hadn't been made was that they no longer took customer's instructions by letter.  This is preposterous but in any event they should have given us prior notice of this if this is really true.  Their attitude is dreadful.  It is like speaking to zombies.  No-one has any common sense or interest in helping the customer, everything is driven by process.  We still haven't resolved it and they now say the only way they will make the transfer is if our two signatories go into a branch with identity documents and do it there.  This is easier said than done and is going to need a two hour round trip for one of our signatories.  We have a standing order to amend next month and if they won't do this with a signed letter I don't know how we are going to do this.  Bear in mind that we are not paying a third party but merely transferring money between our accounts with them.There is zero commitment to customer service, their processes are not at all customer friendly and they are dreadful to deal with.  I don't know where their call centre is physically located but the first member of staff I talked to  had a very strong foreign accent and this combined with a poor quality phone line (which makes me think the call centre was abroad) meant he was difficult to understand and he also did not appear to fully grasp the issues.As a bank they have totally lost the plot of what they are there for and have a poor attitude as far as customer service is concerned.  A bank to avoid.            
                Barclays has their sms service where they send you info to your mobile of your transactions, maintenance and other information related to your account. Currently there are scam texts going through the same route under the same contact on Barclays behalf. "We have detected a suspicious transfer made from your account for 2500 GBP - MMWC LtdIf this is your payment, reply YIf not, please call 0843 289 0370" It appears to be fraud premium number when if called back you are kept waiting in the "queue" for endless time while being charged enormous rate per minute. Barclays admits this ascam going on via their own contacting service however totally refuses to help with this matter and dispute the money. Their answer is: "it is only your fault if you made a call, you should have checked the number before making a call" It is ridiculous as the text comes from them! I am now switching banks and moving away from Barclays if they cannot guarantee security for their customers.            
                UPDATE: more routine maintenance planned taking 6 hours to complete!forever doing essential maintenancein a 24/7 digital world we have Barclays taking down online services for 'essential maintenance' almost weekly and for 15 hours at a time is just RIDICULOUS!!            
                I switched from Halifax, where I was appalled by the service I received- money stolen from my account and accused me of doing it myself, being hung up on multiple times, etc. Barclays have always been fabulous to deal with. Recently I took out a Barclay card with them to help build my credit history and the card arrived very promptly and was easy to register. When it came to paying my first statement the online system kept throwing me out so I called and spoke to two very helpful people who resolved the issue within minutes. My local branch are also really good at helping with queries so well done to Barclays for your customer service.            
                I am from london i was in bolton to see family but on my way down i lost my bank card so i decided to go bolton branch. As soon as i stepped in i was met by a member of staff called muhammed he got a new card ordered for me also showed me a great feature on mobile banking called blue rewards all the staff was very helpfull great service :)            
                Don't understand why certain people are coming up with the comments they are? Can't get an appointment.......can't get this....can't get that. Just done it online, account opened done and dusted 5 mins, the missus been with Barclays 20 years never had and issue. Obviously stuck up individuals and MORONS who are putting 1 star????            
                UK call centres would be much better. Struggle to understand phone banking sometimes            
                We tend to knocks the banks don't we ?  Often with just cause BUT today I have no hesitation in giving Barclays Crawley Sussex 5 well deserved stars.  The guy we dealt with went the extra mile - THANK YOU.            
                They have no idea how to deal with elderly customers. Everything is designed for the young. I have been trying to order a new card for my Dad and it has taken 3 days so far. The call centre is a joke. I cannot make an appointment at the branch. There are no direct line numbers to the branch and all calls route through India.            
                Please  do not follow my example and sign up to Barclays voice security.  Since I signed with them I have been unable to access my account through the automated system I get referred to a personal banker.  I chose to come out of that system and was assured that it would revert back to my previous security.  This has not happened and I am still being put through to a personal banker.  Wasting my time.  I have spent 42 mins trying to get this resolved to no avail.  Am now waiting for a floor manager to contact their it dept then phone me back.  His words sometime maybe the next few days or not.  In the meantime I am still not able to access my account without going through a personal banker.  Wake up don't sign for voice security.            
                Offered me 35k loan based on my credit then when I asked for 15 k i got offered a higher rate than expected. Thought I had no other option and then they declined on affordability when I earn over 3k and month with outgoings under half. TSB offered a cheaper rate and accepted me fully so my opionion of Barclays is awful now. I will be switching my bank to TSB as a result. Much better bank and lender and are straight about everything upfront.            
                Been banking with Barclays since I was about 12 years old and never had any major problems. Their banking app and website are easy to use and the customer service is mostly good, although the staff in their smaller branches are quite often clueless and I've even been told to 'google it' before when they don't know the answer to a question. When I make a payment it comes out of my account immediately which I think is really important in keeping track of your spending etc.I started off on a young persons account which got changed to a student account when I went to uni, this was fine except I had a lot of trouble trying to get my overdraft increased as you only start off with £200, and the maximum they ever let me go to was £300 so not ideal if you need to borrow more than that. My friend also banks with barclays and had her overdraft refused as she had Topshop on her bank statement, even though she could've been buying socks or something for all they knew! I'm now on a graduate account and am happy with it.I also have a savings account with Barclays but am hoping to change it soon as I get very little interest with it. However my Help to Buy ISA is great and was very easy to set up as I already banked with them.            
                Ripped off with Renewal QuoteHome contents insurance through Barclays had been good right up until this years renewal which came in at 50% more than last year. I've had 2 claims with them and they say that shouldn't affect the policy but they claim that despite their policy document clearly stating this that they take in to account all claims. Not what they put in writing and not what I paid for.            
                Absolutely disgusted with this bank put a payment through from april and only released it today! Now over drawn me and not sorted it out saying it was from my old card which i never used!!!!! Never using this bank again!!!! Transfered money over and went out but they never put it on a statment so lost 56 pounds!Worst bank ever!!!            
                If I could give zero stars I would. I am absolutely disgusted by the services this "bank" provides. It is a laughing stock!! Taking money out of an account that has no outgoings and then makes me out to be a liar. What a bag of bull!!! Now £116.43 overdrawn and have been told that I cannot recall any of the outgoings!! SORT YOURSELFS OUT!!            
                The worse business banking ever! you are always out routed to the Philippines!You can literally not get any help when you need it.You have to repeat the same information over and over again! Start your business right  - Start else where            
                The Indian call centre is terrible, on the first call I was promptly cut off, on the second call I could here background talking but no one was talking to me. When I got through on the third attempt the help assistant had really bad English and we both spent half an hour repeating ourselves. Such a frustrating and stressful experience , another Barclays cost cutting nightmare.            
                went one day and asked how to open an account for myself they said to come to the branch and just take seat infront of two offices and wait for my turn after I stayed for over than 30 minutes, a lady who worked their said I can do it upstairs through computer as skype she took me upstairs and when she turned the computer on it was for financial services only!!!! Then she relised I have to make an appointment and its not walk in thing!?! I told her they told me to just come in she said sorry no you need an appointment, okay when is your next available appointment she replied three weeks later!!!! Okay I will wait! When the day of my appointment finally came one hour prior to my appointment I received a phone call they had to cancel my appointment as the guy who spouse to open me an account has double appointment me and another person at the same time???!!!! And he decided to ring me and cancel mine and reschedule me!!! What is this ??? Kids working in this bank!!?? Not intelligent people whatsoever!!!!            
                WARNING !!! The ATM at the George Street Branch in Altrincham UK is EATING debit cards and the staff REFUSE to do anything about it. I was there today a little after 4pm when the machine ate my New York TD Bank debit card  i complained the manager and staff all knew about the issue and did nothing to do resolve it or help. They aren't rude, oh no, rather much much worse, they are zombies, lacking empathy, spouting nonsense instead of taking charge and owning up to their errors. While i was there it ate 2 other peoples cards and as I was leaving it was hapening to another.  STILL no sign NOT TO USE THE MACHINE. They will NOT give you card back, were completely unsympathetic, did nothing to help, brushed me off and told me to issue a complaint.  The worst attempt at customer service i have ever witnessed. I am extremely disappointed in how i was treated and how i need to fend for myself without any access to my money. If I could give negative stars I would .....just what the world DOESN'T need more bankers who can't think on their feet or outside the box to help people when it was BARCLAYS equipment who was to blame. Simply useless and vacant.            
                2 stars for how long i was with them and how useful they were for about 15-18 years!! but poor form from barclays having logged a complaint and they fail to even look at it until 7 days after the final date of response! Also when I last went in to branch they were useless and they just point you to a pc unless you want a mortgage or loan off them. (mines with other companies who offer better rates!) first thing im doing saturday is leaving barclays and moving banks. Hopefully they will have staff who can actually talk to you in branch about your account and not point you at a pc, if i wanted a pc i would have stopped at home!            
                25 years as a customer and now Customer Service at Barclays is at its lowest quality in all that time.The branches in larger towns lack any customer focus at all.  A large team of "pouncing" staff directing you to their automated services with half of the staff just smiling and twiddling their thumbs whilst there is a queue of 10 people needing to deal face to face with the ONE or if you are lucky TWO tellers.The queues diminish more quickly not because of service but because people cant wait any longer and have to leave the bank walking past the smiling thumb twiddling staff.Call their customer service line and you are guaranteed(after the long wait) to get someone who has no ability to just for a second effectively stand in the customers shoes.  If they are unable to answer your question they are not allowed to pass you on to one of theirs "not customer facing staff" but instead register your very basic enquiry as a "Complaint" which gives them up to 8 weeks  to respond to your enquiry and all of a sudden the "complaint" becomes more of an issue than your original enquiry.Their CEO to me is completely out of touch with the real world and clearly does not monitor their calls or spend time in their branches - if he did thinks would be much better as they used to be.  No wonder Barclays are the most complained about bank - their structure turns everything into a complaint.When you get an outcome to your complaint they just want to throw their shareholders money at you and thank you for the feedback !All they need to do is put their staff in the "right" places and properly equip their staff to answer the questions asked by customers.            
                Very disappointing attitude and service. Makes a drama out of the most straightforward simple things. They failed to send me a PIN, then refused to allow me to access my own account even after correctly answering security questions. Then they sent me a PIN which didn't work, and refused to request another one for me, and only did so after I offered to answer security questions, and showed them a letter from their own customer services department in response to the initial complaint, in which it clearly said, "If a customer does not have their PIN with them, we would then attempt to identify the customer by asking security questions instead."Dealing with this bank has been so difficult I really wish I'd opened an account somewhere else.            
                Stay away. They don't protect their customers. They don't care their customers            
                Been a customer for only 9 months, I find the service incomparable and absolutely spot on.  Yes a lot of checks and questions needs to be dealt with for any kind of application but is it not the least you should expect from a serious financial institute?  Once you have their trust and they have yours, it can only feel like it is the beginning of a long, solid relationship.            
                Have had lots of problems with my account but Barclays have always accepted responsibility. Compensated for all loses and have always put me in a better position then I would have been if these mistakes had not happend.A++++++*            
                I have a family member who uses Barclays bank. Money was removed from their account without their knowledge or consent, so the activity was reported to Barclays as fraudulent. Barclays refunded the money... but then sent a letter to say that after an investigation, Barclays had determined that the payment had been authorised by the account holder (not true) and therefore it did not count as fraud. This contradicts guidance given by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). A letter to this effect was sent by recorded delivery. Barclays never responded to the letter and then withdrew the money that they had refunded. Not at all professional and I would never recommend them.            
                Can't fault this bank. Had my account with them for the last 8 years. Find them very easy to work with although can take some time to talk to the right department. Got a personal loan and general account with them. Very happy!            
                After 3 months this account is pretty much dead in the water. I opened up an account from Barclays. First of all, I had to wait 5 weeks for the passcode. That was bad enough. When I eventually did get into my account, I went into MOVE MONEY to transfer some funds from that account to a supplier. I got big red letters and an error code of 9802. Back I went to Barclays physically and online. Went through all the procedure, got complaint ref numbers, call ref numbers explained in simple terms to what seemed like an Indian Call Centre more call ref numbers, more complaint ref numbers. The bloke at the local branch came to the conclusion that the account had been deactivated.  He battled away. The online team was blaming the normal account team and vice-versa. Anyway, I've had enough. Like the people below, went to Lloyds. Not a problem with them. Up and running. Barclays - ship of fools and not fit for purpose. At 14.26 on 16 May. Account still not capable of making payments.            
                Went with my daughter to open her first bank account. First tried to phone call centre to make appointment, could not make the lady in India understand. So I hung up. Went on live chat to make the appointment, it took close to 30mins to sort the appointment . I was told 3.30 on Monday. Went to the bank at 3.30 and was told the appointment was  scheduled for 2.30. I had a screen shot of the appointment. Then they told myself and my daughter that her provisional driving license , birth certificate , NHS card , National insurance number letter. A  recent utility bill  and my passport was not enough  for identification  purposes . And they could not open her a 16-19 yr old account.  Wonderful how stupid. So I walked down to lloyds bank asked if they could squeeze us in.  Pleasant chatty people said yes .They asked for identification I showed in the selection of things  we had  and they said provisional driving license is just perfect photo ID. So anyone thinking about  Barclays Bank just don't bother go to Lloyds .            
                Very poor service when trying to administer an old ING Direct mortgage online.  They insist I open a current account to allow me Internet access (Mis-selling?).  Phone service is abysmal, provided by Indian call-centre staff with a poor grasp of English and an even worse attitude problem who will put you on permanent hold if they don't know how to deal with an issue.  Don't bother going into the branches to sort out, the staff there are at the mercy of support from the call centre so doomed from the start.  Best advice is to ask for a complaint reference number each time you call, let the UK complaints team attempt to solve the issue then get the Ombudsman involved when they can't (or refuse).Even better advice is not to bank with them at all, unfortunately I'm  stuck with a mortgage with a very favourable rate at the moment, but seriously considering giving it up to avoid the constant hassle that Barclays seems to like to inflict on its customers.            
                Don't waste your time with the Barclays Tech pack. Sent my iPhone off for repair. The same day received it back it was overheating and within 4 weeks of repair the screen is bleeding. - LSG have voided my remaining 12 month warranty with Apple so have to claim under LSG. Advisor straight away also if I'd like to make another claim and pay £50 excess. I refuse and put through to customer relations and may have to pay an excess if they believe I caused the damage. They offer little assistance.....Barclays won't help as the complaint is with there chosen service provider. Waste of money!            
                I got very bad experience about this bank. And I not recommend people to use the bank at all. I were ask in branch bank services to help to order years statement about to proof change my new passport and notice very important and urgent. Twice times ask them their say to me to between 7 days ! First time I been wait for a month  and second time I wait for 3 weeks almost 2 months. This is very bad service and  no responsibility at all!            
                My local branch in Liverpool is chronically understaffed. Long queues are the norm. There are 3 malfunctioning machines which have taken the place of real people. Barclays are making billions in profit but treat their customers with contempt. Been a customer for 25 years. Am looking to move - probably to Nationwide            
                Barclays Stockbrokers CFD and Spread Trading and gain Capital who are associated with them, should both, never be trusted under any circumcises, sorry circumstances LOL heres why: What they do is, okay for example, you enter a trade at 165 USD per CFD unit long with a target price of 190 and a stop loss of 162, on such and such a day, it goes down to 163.50 and then rallies up to say 170, theyll close you out at maybe 161 and when you complain the price didnt reach that level, theyll refer you to look at the bid chart, youll see it went down to 163.50 low of the day and point it out, then they just claim it was down to world time differences, obviously BS. As we all know what time it happened in one part of the world to another is of total irrelevence. But they will just stick by the story. If you have an account with them, best to draw all what you have left and go elsewhere, it is impossible to win with this sort of thing going on. The whole platform is therefore just completely unsafe to use.            
                If i I could give zero star, I would! Staff in Warrington branch are useless! You have to wait ages in the queue while they talk to each other other with no consideration to customers what so ever. We have to wait until they are ready? Hello, customers comes firts. But seems at this bank we are just a number. I gonna switch to Halifax.            
                Unfortunately I cannot give Barclays Bank zero stars for their customer service. Both their online 'chat' and telephone  customer care services are abysmal.  I used their online chat service recently, and the  agents who I spoke to (four of them) decided to just not bother repling to my questions when they didn't understand, which was  most of the time, they just left the chat running without typing anything. I was on one chat for 30 minutes waiting for a reply. I then had to resort to telephone customer services and the guy who answered was obviously reading from his online script, which he was struggling with and really had no idea what I was talking about. I am not blaming this person, as I can speak no Hindi whatsoever. I am blaming Barclays for providing a shoddy cost cutting service. If you are going to  provide a service for English speaking people, use people who speak English for that service! I have banked with Barclays for over 30 years but will now be taking my custom elsewhere            
                No stars. I am so frustrated and disgusted with barclays. I live in Australia and all I need is a pin number Sent to me so I can use my card when I visit England in a months time.I call the number advertised on the barclays site and get an Indian call centre. Let's just say I repeated my postcode 8 times and he still could not understand. I could barely understand what he was saying,. I believe the details he managed to muster and input into his system were probably incorrect.the result being that ' I failed'  the security  questions and therefore he 'could not discuss the account with me.This is the short version, I was on the call for 45 mins from Aus to UK probably cost $30 +All absolutely pointless. He told me to write a letter and sign it and ask them for a pin, they can send one then. I said this will take up to a month by which point I'll be in the UK. He told me to rethink the abswers tobmy security questions. I know my own freaking mothers maiden name and and know my freaking address.I said can I get a new pin number from the bank branch when I'm in england then, he said they'll send it to my address. ( which is in Australia) so will be pointless.OMG what the hell! Who are these spuds. I'm so angry. So now I'll have to go into bank branch with passport, drivers license, etc ....and withdraw wads if cash and hope 1. I don't lose it    2.dont get muggedBarclay's are completely unhelpful and When I get to UK I will take all my money and close this crap bank for good.            
                Everytime I get paid transactions are coming from my bank account at first it was amount such as 64 pound a week ridiculous  amounts and now even though I have phoned 3 times for my bank to stop direct debit and iv have 24 pound fees on my bank account 8 pound today for not paying my direct debit even tho it was canceled from  the actually business and the bank account but I'm still getting charge apparently it's my fault and not even been refunded I'm finding a new bank and if ur only just signing up I'd say not too really shocking            
                Absolute disgrace. Computerized switchboard service which is impractical and inadequate. Call waiting times are excessive. Calls eventually answered in Mumbia with poorly speaking agents who dont know what they are talking about. Honestly never experienced such shocking customer service. Stay away from this bank.            
                Yet again Barclay's make life impossible. I registered for internet banking and first discovered they had the wrong address on record but I then succeeded. The next time I tried to login I was asked for different information I didn't have, then I was shut out and told to ring. When I did I was told they didn't have sufficient verification and could do no more and I would have to go into a branch.The other complaint is trying to find the correct number to call, the website keeps sending you round in circles.            
                You can wait for hours to speak to someone and when you get though to them they haven't got a clue and all they can say "im very sorry sir" and that is more og less it. Keep away from this bank - they couldn't care less about you! and your business!            
                Misquoted a the price and given the wrong terms on my Barclays mortgage.Constantly given the wrong information throughout the process. Genuinely shocking.            
                Terrible customer service. I have had a Barclays account for 17 years now and never bothered to change but think it's about time now.I keep getting through to a customer service centre in India every time I call and put on hold every whenI have a specific question. They have been useless at answering any queries and I usually get a different answer depending on the person at the other end of the line.My card was subject to fraud recently and Barclays do not give automatic refund, it's a painless process through their Fraud department and waiting for enquiries (even though the amounts are small).I've been charge OD fees even though I am a premier banking customer. Only to find out that my account was downgraded without me being notified. The answer I get is that Barclays are able to change their terms and conditions at any point without notifying the customer and will not be responsible for any fees charged to account as a result. Incredible!Total lack of transparency and customer service with this bank.            
                Cant deny the App is the best out there, fast and responsive.            
                Terrible and slow customer service with ridiculous waiting times and customer service operators with foreign accents far too thick to understand. I have been transferred from department to department and made to wait for far too long.            
                Terrible customer services/ complaint management experience led me to leave Barclays after 15 years. I was a good customer who caused no issues and they offered nothing worthwhile over that time period when many other banks do. Was really needing an excuse to leave as only familiarity kept me there and that excuse came! Worst rates for everything compared to most other banks. Switched in 7 days via Martin Lewis, got bonuses & never looked back. Easy process and so pleased I've done it. Should've done it years ago. Thanks for essentially nothing Barclays! I've voted with my feet and reviewed here to share my disappointing experience like I said I would.            
                Barclays are a horrible company. I have just tried to paid a company which I have paid twice before, hey have blocked my card even through I responded to the text from the Bank saying that I was happy paying this company! Now I have just rang them to get them to turn my card back on they will not do it unless I download their phone app! When I refused to download this app onto my phone they stated that they will not sort out my card and the only why to do it is to go into the Bank! How can you do this when you are at work? So unless I can get into a Bank tomorrow I will be left on a Bank Holiday with no money! Keep well away from Barclays, as soon as I can get into town I will be changing my BANK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            
                Barclays are a horrible company to bank for! They have put my account under review without my knowledge and I have been in a situation now for 3 week without no access to money because I work long hours and unable to get to an actual branch and withdraw my money. They have been so rude to saying I'm a silly little girl when I tried to make a account. I am in the process of switching banks and Barclays have refused to help me switch banks. They told me it is in their terms and conditions that they can place my account under review at any time but due to having a young persons account first they did not sent me the current account terms and conditions as they done that process automatically.            
                I'm a Barclays business customer and have had a nightmare until dealing with Ajay Sharma in the Hornchurch branch. Whilst he is on the personal banking team he took an hour and a half out of his day to help me out. Prior to this is was really displeased with the service and he has changed my opinion.Great customer service and very knowledgable.            
                Worst bank ever in UK, I so regret even trying to apply, what a big mistake. 2 months ago I applied for a Barclays Business current account after 2 months with a lot of back and forth with hundreds of excuses from the business manager in Hagley Road branch, Birmingham, I filled up a complain about it and they never answered me back ,didnt even bother to read my formally written complains, I ended up giving up, I applied for a NatWest business account they opened my account in 2 businesses days. Really people stay away from this guys they WILL waste your time and dont even care about you!!!!!I hate this bank so much, I cant even describe how disappointed I am, ruining people's dreams every day!!!!!!!!!!!!!            
                Have numerous accounts elsewhere but recently opened a barclays account online,approved overdraft at same time.Painless,easy almost instant opening, card and pin received within 3 days.Online banking is good but the app has to be one of the best around,so fast and i can do everything i need to from the app including direct calling customer services if needed with no need to go through any long winded security procedures all over again as they know who you are from the call as its from within the app.Going to open some bonds within Barclays soon.Would recommend to all.            
                I gave Barclays a chance as i wanted a basic separate account to save for something specific and i wish i had never bothered! I applied online and was given an error message telling me that they could not proceed and that i needed to go into branch. I do not have time for this so i just decided to leave it. About a week later i received a text message telling me that an account had been opened. I then opened a few savings accounts for surplus income and set up two standing orders to pay into them. I have kept the PDF receipts confirming the standing orders had been set up but low and behold they could not be found anywhere on my online banking and when i phoned the call centre they could not see them either! Needless to say these standing orders did not get paid (it is a good job it was not a rent payment!) despite me having receipts to confirm them so how is this possible in the 21st century digital world! I cannot bear to speak to the foreign call centre anymore as they simply do not understand what i am saying and i dont have time to waste going into a branch so i have closed all the accounts and gone elsewhere! There are other banks that have much better systems and methods of contacting them so please dont waste your time with Barclays!            
                It is a shame we cannot put 0 star as they have they worst call centre in the world. I spoke to 4 different person in relation to my debit card which was blocked, got 4 different answers. One said my card doesn't exist, another one said it is working, another one said it was blocked and I failed to give the corrects answer, the last one told me to go to a local branch. At the local branch the guy told me that as a Barclays employee he was treated in a worst matter than Barclays customers by their overseas call centre.So if you were thinking about switching your bank account to Barclays, think again!            
                the worst chat service-  I contacted them by using this platform around 10 times and there wasn't even one instance when the representative was able to have a resolution or sort out an issue, most of the times they would just repeat the same question all over again, the most appaling chat service I have ever encountered and I am not exxagerating. they seem to be completely unfocused, probably overwhelmed with too many chat windows, otherwise I cannot explain the consitent lack of attention. there might be another explanation - complete lack of interest, unprofessionalism and ultimately stupidity.            
                Barclays did not apologize for sponsoring the Nazi regime. They are the worst bank in UK with the lowest interest on savings and the worst services overall. Do not use this bank!!!            
                Poor staff knowledge and attitude. Didn't want to upgrade my child's account and reasons were ridiculous finally admitted they were understaffed! Before Barclays was a good bank buymt due to understaffing and employing unprofessional ignorants it went downhill and I am moving my money to paragon bank.            
                Just closed my account today (Wednesday) no notice nothing. The last hours events , went to the cash machine to take some money out and mY card was taken, went to log online and kicked of . When I called the number provided I was told my accounts closed and they can't give me a reason why, he told me to refer to there terms and conditions which states they can close your account with no notice. I asked what happens with all my money DD etc and was told I have to find alternative banking now as no money can go in or out of this account from monday . 1 week before all my bills are due out  Customer for 2 years 3.5K salary paid in each month same bills going out. No borrowing , good credit and 20K savings. The bank is ruthless and will dump you (who ever you are)  in it when ever they see fit. The bank looks to be losing alot of customers with the sane thing. Don't not rely on this bank for the simplest of things such as banking .I'm looking at purchasing a house in the coming months needless to say I won't by applying for a mortgage through Barclay's            
                I just went in there to enquire about opening an account. The lady in there was not at all welcoming and looks like they don't want people to come in to open the account. She was more happy to say you can open somewhere else before even knowing what I need. I think barclays will head towards shutdown if they have people like this talking to customer.This was ealing broadway branch            
                I tried to ring register my fathers death at Hoyland , Barnsley branch and was met with the worse customer service I have experienced of ANY bank As soon as I explained I wanted to register  the death she bellowed at me that I "couldn't do that as she was serving customers " Absolutely no condolences offered or any semblance of understanding I asked what I needed to do and she told me I needed to make an appointment, as it would take too long for her (or anyone else in the Branch ) to sort out .After much huffing and puffing she accessed the appointment system and offered me an appointment over  a week hence. When I suggested another branch and after much head scratching she said I couldn't do that "as the system wouldn't allow her to book it in". I had tried to call this branch beforehand but couldn't get through as no one would answer the phone After explaining this to the cashier she bellowed that they couldn't be expected to answer calls when they were serving customers! I  walked out after not registering my fathers death and walked into Natwest where a lovely advisor sorted everything out for me. I suspect the Barclays cashier was  almost showing off to her colleague and other customers waiting.  At a time when I felt most vulnerable and just needed a bit if understanding Barclays failed me. All our accounts will be closed now            
                I have had a Barclays account for over a year now and have been generally pleased with the service i have received. The online banking is fairly easy to use, i have never phoned their call centre as i barely ever phone my bank and the mobile app is decent enough. My main gripe is that i constantly get mail asking to get overdrafts, loans etc. I already have a barclaycard with them, I do not need any extra finance and to be honest i see it is a waste of paper, apart from that I have no issues with them. I also like the fact you can personalise you're debit card with them. Overall a decent bank with no major issues, i just dread the day I have to phone them up if it is as bad as other people say it is            
                Booked an appointment. Arrived at the branch to find it closed.            
                Top service at the Clacton on sea branch.They are always helpful and staff there are very helpful at all times even when it's very busy in the branch.Also the telephone banking are fabulous and helpful I had money taken fro my account and they soon sorted it out for me I couldn't ask for better than that I must say Barclays is the best bank I've banked with keep up the great service.            
                In one word, theives. I have had an account with Barclays for 22 years without issue. 3 weeks ago I went to make a payment and it got declined. I then tried to access online banking and received and error with a number to call. I was told that my bank account had been suspended and I should have received a letter. I had not received anything from Barclays. I was out through to the fraud team and was told that the account was closed and they were not able to tell me the reason why and I should 'refer to my terms and conditions'. The suggestion being I had violated them. I have a regular, boring account: wages in, direct debits out. Same every month. So I went to the branch near work, same response. All they could do was log a complaint. I was assured it was being fast tracked and someone would call me back that afternoon. Of course no one called. I then decided to try Twitter. I spoke to a lady on there who was very nice and called me to discuss. She also was unable to give me any information but told me to go back to the branch with proof of income. So the next day I went to my local branch with 6 months of payslips, my employment contract, three utility bills, my passport and drivers license. Two hours of valiant effort by the staff at the Croydon branch ended up hopeless. They were told by HQ they would not release the funds from my bank account over the counter and I would have to post all the documents to an address in Coventry. I did this the following day along with a covering letter. I received a response that my query would be dealt with by 12th April. Guess what? Today is the 12th April and I have had no response. They are currently holding all of my funds, not replying to anything, wasting my time not to mention causing me unsure stess ans embarrassment. I have had to live on borrowed money from friends for three weeks. I am a single person with a mortgage and no means to pay. All for nothing. It's atrocious. I have since got a new account with Lloyds but I need that money in my Barclays account. It's going to be a battle and it's very frustrating. On the plus side, I have a very large following on social media and my good friend is an Editor at The Guardian so currently writing all of this down to hopefully name and shame in the press. My advice, keep pushing them, log a complaint with the ombudsmen and if nothing happens go to the press and consider filing a case with the small claims court. Document everything and record all phone calls. Theives. Stay well away.            
                I opened an account for my son when he was 15 years old. At the age of 16 he was able to run the account without me. During the summer last year he got a little job cash in hand helping out a friend, doing odd jobs as he had just opened a restaurant. My son decided he would save up to go on a skiing trip the following year. 8 months later my son had offered his services to few friends for cash, again odd jobs. His account was flourishing! He brought himself a PlayStation and was so proud of his achievements and independence. However, just before Christmas he went to withdraw cash to be told his account had been frozen due to fraud and that someone would be in touch. As a 16 year old boy he assumed it was under control.  A month went by and he heard nothing so I decided to intervene.It transpired that over £3000 was put in and paid out and two accounts were opened in his name, one of which was an ISA which we discovered used a fake NI number. The bank decided they no longer wanted to be my sons bank and closed his account. They CANNOT ascertain where the money came from, they are not concerned that the other accounts were set up with fake ID and without my sons consent either. When I asked them why my son was not alerted to a new account payee been set up (as usually they text you to confirm it's you) they had no answer. So basically they are condoning fraud and poor defenceless children are NOT safeguarded against fraud. They are a bunch of cowboys. My son has lost almost £800 as they are refusing to give it back. I have now passed comlaint to FOS.Moral of the story , do NOT let anyone under the age of 21 bank with them!!!            
                I had a business account, they have no care for your needs what so ever!! they have put me into arrears after paying for things i had asked them not too... they closed my account for -500 pound how ridiculous is that! they are aware how my business works and that it is slower at certain times of the year. they pass the buck constantly and never resolve anything worst bank experience ever!!!!! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE            
                Who needs this bank?I tried to open a new Business Account with their Knightsbridge branch in London for a new company. Not only had I waited almost three weeks for the appointment, which by itself is ridiculous, but I soon learned I was no closer to opening an account after all this waiting period. This created a lot of delays for me to get started with the business as I needed a bank account.The "Barclays Business Manager" demanded to get answers to 30+ questions for just opening a basic business account. Everything from share holders details, to percentage split, to profit margins, what countries the company would trade with, investment amounts, confirmation where funds come from and on and on. It was bizarre.No matter how many times I told the account manager that the company has not yet started trading and none of this information was relevan and I needed only a basic account so I could start trading, he refused to proceed. The manager demanded that I could not proceed until I would provide "proof" to all these questions.After spending considerable time getting information together [to prove that I did not need all that information(!)] I called Barclay's to expedite the account opening process. But of course it got no easier after that. I got stuck in Barclay's phone system merry-go-round which is as bad as it gets. There I was told I could not proceed further unless I answered "security questions". I didn't even have an account yet, so how can I answer security questions? I then got transferred from department to department and had to repeat the same lengthy process each time. When I asked for the business account manager I had dealt with, they could not find him on the system. I had to talk to four different people to proceed further while communicating with a person that sounded like a 12-year-old child. Once they actually found the manager in their databse, I was told that they can't give out his contact details because Barclay's does not give out the phone number or emails of their business managers unless they have personally given customers these details (Wow! A bank that can't provide their business contact details? How about that). This is now 30 minutes later after wasting time on the phone with the bank. They told me that they would 'leave a message' to the business account manager to call me. As if it couldn't get more insane, they told me that "if" the manager did not call me back I should call them again to go through the same 30-minute merry-go-round and THEN they could provide me with the direct number that were not allowed to give to me that day. I asked them why they could not give me his contact details now so I could take care of my banking business? But they refused to. This is how they treat a potential future customer? Just imagine how bad the service is AFTER you bank with these clowns!Unreal. Why would I want to put my business into the hands of this bank after this experience?Why would a bank not provide the contact details of their own account managers? It makes no sense. As a customer you should have the right to reach anyone in your branch without this kind of a ridiculous proess and odd secrecy. The new accounts department is basically a sales department. Imagine to be unable to access the contact details of a sales man? Don't laugh but with Barclay's it's not possible. This is a BANK behaving suspect like an underground maffia organisation. It was simply the most absurd thing I had heard. I don't recommend Barclay's to ANYONE looking to open an account. Not only does it seem like this bank has no service to their name, but it's a mayhem of an automated system that is a nightmare to get around and once you manage to get ahold of a person, it gets no better. It's clear that banking is a constant problem with them. STAY CLEAR of BARCLAY's.UPDATE: The Business account manager never called me although he was left both a message and an email to call me (according to customer support, whatever that means with Barclay's).Go figure. I went to another bank.            
                Introducing Barclays Business Banking...have absolutely no concept of the needs of businesses.Applied for an additional signatory on an account 6 weeks ago.  Only communication from them was a letter asking that we re-sign a form or remove the new director from Companies House because their form needed both director signatures (not that that was obvious) - nothing else (no welcome, no online/phone banking details, no debit/credit cards etc).  Chased up to see what was going on, but couldn't get any help through the business telephone banking service because I couldn't pass security because I don't have the information they haven't sent me.  Escalated to a supervisor, and got the same idiotic stance.  Tried to lodge a complaint - just got left on hold for 20 minutes.  Tried to call the local branch, but ended up back with the telephone service in India.  Asked to be put through to the branch and they cut me off. Wow - where now?  How about, Barclays you just send me some info per the service you charge for, and as any competent bank would?Deeply engrained organisational ineptitude, and zero respect for the customer.I would try and move the account...but I can't get into it to even do that!Sadly knowing also that this review will make absolutely no difference to their service or even elicit a response...            
                I do business banking with Barclays. It is the worst experience in my life dealing with bank... One month I am trying to reach business banking manager and no luck. The advisors on the phone promising to give me a call back and.... no call back...            
                Three months to get a debit card on an account I've had eight years. Fed up with completing endless forms and speaking to their overseas call centre.            
                Most people may have heard of the Barclays rate fixing scandal and their general unethical behaviour over the years.  This review is just a moan about their relentless junk mail.  Every month without fail the same 'offers' to get into debt with them come through the letterbox.  It's a waste of paper, money and energy.  I've tried everything to get them to stop, but to no avail.  In an age where everyone is encouraging us to 'go paperless' (including Barclays) it's a joke that they keep on churning out more paper in an effort to solicit more profit.            
                Have been a Barclays customer for 50 years, including running two businesses with them in the past.  Now hold two a/cs with them.  Platinum a/c). Never had an unplanned overdrawn. Credit rating with Experien is 999. Applied for a sole a/c. Refused! Had chatline conversation 'we cannot disclose our reasons'. Bah!            
                THE BARCLAYS IOS APP IS ABDOLUTE RUBBISH AND EVERY TIME THEY UPDATE IT IT GETS WORSE. ITS FULL OF CONFFUSION AND STUPIDITY AND MUDT BE DESUGNED BY A MORON. . ONE CANNOT DO BASIC TASKS LIKE SAVE DOWDNLOADED STATEMENTS. ALL DOCUMENTS HAVE NOW BEE MIXED UP ON TO ONE PAGE FOR MY ALL ACCOUNTS AND IMPOSDIBLE TO FIND A PARTICULAR DOCS. TO COMPLSIN TO BARCLAYS,YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY  AT PREMIUM RATE  TO CALL THEM BECAUSE THERES  NO MESSAGE LINK AS NORMAL WITH BANK APPS. BARCLAYS ALSO HAVE QUIETLY INTRODUCED ALL KINDS OF CHARGES AND EXHORBITANT CHANGES FOR  INTERBANK BARCS TRANSFERS THAT USED TO BE FREE. CHECK YOUR STATEMENT,!!. A CLICK ON CHARGES DOESNT REALLY  EXPLAIN WHY THE CHARGES ARE FOR BUT FURTHER GIBBERISH ..VOMPLIANTS ON PAPER ARE MOSTLY  IGNORED.ITS  DISGUSTING TIME TO DUMP BARCLAYS I BEEN LAZY LOYAL TOO LONG AND THEY TAKE THEGOT TOO ARROGANT            
                What an absolute disgrace barclays is!!!! Numerous web chats with different members off staff which all of them promised to resolve my querys and just cut off the conversation everytime!!!! I have companys debiting money from my account without my consent and havent done a thing about it!!! Your not even worth that 1 star i had to give a star to have my say!!!! I advise everyone NOT to bank with BARCLAYS!!! I have lost so much money since being with this bank and problems that STILL havent been resolved...disgusting! AVOID BARCLAYS!!!!            
                Have been attempting to get online access to my mortgage account since November 2016.  If you try online to arrange this you go through the process only to receive at the end an error message with a code (and please note that most of their staff do not know what the error code means).  After eventually getting through to someone who did know what to do I was sent a pin number by post and was informed that my membership number would follow in another letter, so that I could get online.  This never arrived.  I have phoned and after answering several security questions, to which I got 'thank you, that is correct' to every answer I gave, I was then informed that I could not go any further as their system had highlighted that I had answered a question wrong.  When asked which question I was told the system did not give them that information.  When asked why they had said 'thank you, that is correct' to every answer I gave, I got no response.  Therefore, after another number of calls I am still no further to getting online access to my mortgage account.  There is no customer service at Barclays, they are a joke.            
                Recently swapped our accounts from Santander. Very impressive online banking system so happy to recommend            
                I can't even make purchases over £500 as my account is locked and I have to ring the Fraud department. Every. Single. Time. Aaaargggh!I just don't get it. Why?            
                Never had one good experience with Barclays cost me a fortune and service was poor, moved accounts elsewhere free banking free travel insurance and no problems!            
                Barclays misled me, took a long time over the simplest task.I had to constantly put up with awful service and when you walk into a branch you cannot find anyone that can help. They are not a bank that you can rely on to help your business. For a company that has such high costs you would expect better.            
                All i want to do is discuss several mortgage options to help my daughter by her first home, simple you would think.Nope, after searching a lot for a contact number and going to a continental call centre to be given the number for mortgage appointments, i then found an alternative which i called.all the person on the phone wanted to do was pin me down to which mortgage i wanted , when i explained i wanted to help our daughter to by her first home they insisted on speaking to her, i have all her details and she is at work, so there is nothing more they need, but that would not satisfy them.so i insisted again that i have several options and would like to talk to a human face to face.the reply i got was "thats not how we do things sir" i need to speak with your daughter.so after trying several my times i explained they can not be the bank for us if i cant talk to someone and i will go somewhere else.reply  "ok sir, bye"Well that is how other banks do it, you know what would have happened.They would have asked lots of probing questions and then arranged to meet someone in a branch.So why the bull run around, where have all the humans gone???never mind plenty of other banks can have our money instead.            
                Can't believe how bad these are. I had an overdraft to pay off which i finished paying off a while back. During this time i set up a new bank account so I did not have any extra money going into the Barclays account so they did not replace my debit card. After paying this off and transferring some money into the account I asked for a new debit card ( my credit rating is really good too). I was told to go into the branch with photo ID. I went into the bank with all my ID and details and asked for a new debit card and authorisation card so i could use this for other parts of the online banking. I also put more money into the bank at the same time. The man behind the counter said he had requested a new debit card for me. I waited for  6 working days as i was told 5. I only received an authorisation card but no debit card. I then progressed to the online chat complaints system who had a conversation with me, she apologised and told me to go back to the branch with my ID and request a debit card again (which is exactly what I had already done) and offered £25 compensation if i was willing to accept this. Before i could accept this, she wrote that connection had been lost even though i was still logged in and typing, so guess what, no compensation. I then complained by secure message online as i now had my authorisation card and received an automated email saying contact within 5 working days, 6 working days later no answer, even though they say they will let you know who is dealing with your complaint. I then decided to complain again and still nothing. As they cannot seem to do anything right and do nothing with regards to my account I decided to transfer all the money I had in my account to my Natwest bank instead.            
                I have just transferred by main current account from Société Générale in France to Barclays in Hammersmith in London with ease.  The whole process took approx. 9 days, and I am now fully active.  I found the website very easy to use, and the telephone support was exceptional.If you are moving your current account from overseas, I highly recommend Barclays.A top bank with great customer support.            
                we have only just joined barclays about 3 weeks ago transfered our credit card over from another bank because they were so slow we have got a 12 pound fine and will effect are credit score was told it would be sorted before we had to pay our monthly fee we have also transfered saveings over from another bank we are not happy with the service wish we had not bothered .            
                Absolutely awful - rude staff chippy and unhelpful the whole system of how Barclays work is ridiculous. Just refer you to go to the branch constantly. Highly unhelpful. especially in this day and age            
                Today, yet again, 2 letters arrived for my (adult) children containing Barclaycards. No one in my family even has a Barclays account and I consider the enclosure of an actual card to be a form of gratuitous entrapment, putting temptation into the hands of people who may well not be in financial position to cope with a credit card. Each letter offered a different interest rate, the lower rate being presented for my son who is in much better financial position than my daughter who's proposed interest was a lot higher.I find this type of marketing offensive on so many levels! My children have not lived here for many years so why are these things still coming here? Surely failure to "keep up" opens the way to fraudulent applications?Speculative promotions (literally "fishing") cost money which would be better spent improving services and reducing banking rates, which would benefit everyone.The fact that the least well off have to bear higher rates only bears out the predatory nature of this type of promotion.This type of promotion reminds me of the "Charity Christmas Card Scam" from a few years ago which caused so much unhappiness to the unwary.I would suggest a better approach would be an internet campaign, enabling prospective card holders to make reasoned decisions about their ability to afford expensive items such as credit cards.            
                Over stringent fraud checks, cant even access my own money with visa debit card despite having the funds in place and able to log onto my online account, now they expect me to go to a branch with ID because I couldnt remember which email account I had used, resulting in a missed crucial investment opportunity.            
                I opened an account with Barclays in 2012. All was going great until mid 2014. After work, on my way home I tried to make a purchase and it was declined due to my account being frozen. Upon phoning up, they told me I had made multiple large payments, reducing my balance to almost zero and subsequently resulting in my card being blocked. After a bit of questioning and discussion with the fraud department, it turns out someone had phoned up impersonating me and gotten access to my account. Barclays refused to take responsiblity and only backed down when I took legal action to get my funds recovered. That, in all fairness should have been a warning to switch banks, but unfortunately for I've stuck with them. Through all that, even to this day.. I'm on hold, in queue for up to 30 minutes on the phone for a basic support request, and no matter what number I phone, even if it's the designated number for the issue I'm enquring about, they still feel the need to transfer me to the wrong department time and time again. On a good take it can take 30-40 minutes to actually get through to the right person. The only thing worse than this, that's happened on more than one occasion, is when I've been on hold for ages, I hear the phone pick up, then go back down again and the call cuts. Why? It seems like they have a valid reason too, but don't think it's because of something I'm doing. I've worked in Customer Services before when I was younger, and I know how much it can ruin your day to have some angry person taking an issue out on you because of a fault that wasn't yours. It's just not something I do, I'm always polite on the phone to Support Staff no matter how pathetic the company itself is being, they are just doing their jobs. It also seems that basic English is not a requirement to work for Barclays support. I've got no problem with people not speaking English, but if they aren't able to.. they should not be doing a support role for English customers. I'm a very clear, native English speaker, I work with people who struggle with English, but so many times I have to get passed to somebody else because I'm not understood no matter how much I simplify it. I even had a friend next to me agree that on one occasion, they should really have no problem understanding me if they spoke basic English. New year, New problems. Over the last few months, Barclays have been putting a security block on my account over the MOST INSIGNIFICANT purchases. So many times I try to buy something only to get my card declined. The reason for the block? I bought McDonalds the same morning. My cards been frozen over 10 times this year and it's only early March. I had my card Frozen after buying beers at my local shop for NYE party.A week later my card was frozen because I paid for a monthly music subscription. I filled my car up and that got my card frozen. A few weeks ago I renewed my gym membership, card frozen agan. I spent £1.80 on parking... £1.80!!!!! and my card was frozen again.a few more stupid ones..Then again last night.. £7 got my card blocked. This is beyond pathetic, I swear my account spends more time blocked than unblocked and EVERY SINGLE TIME it turns out to be legitimate purchases, not fraud. It's like Barclays are intentionally doing this to annoy me. Something is up with their security system. I got off the phone over an hour ago, she told me my card would work again within 15 minutes.. I have just tried to complete the purchase I was in the middle of making and my card is still not working. This is ridiculous. Whatever you do, do not go with Barclays, Go with Santander, Lloyds, Anyone else just make sure it's not this trash company. Oh and the App sucks too.            
                After 11 years with Barclays I'm off to another thanks to thier rude and shocking customer service. I made a large online transfer which seemed to be delayed for security purposes, fine by me that is a good system. However I rang to check how long the process would take and I was advised I need to answer security questions, not a problem. I provided all correct information as I have in all previous communication with this bank and I was told I gave wrong information. The man, who frankly couldn't speak a word of English clearly, blocked my account and hung up on me! I rang back and spoke to a manager who said it would take two hours to listen to the call and investigate. So I waited, did not get a call back. I rang again and was made to wait for 45 mins for the manager to come back 'onto the floor' because apparently Barclays staff are not allowed to leave their desks!! When I finally spoke to the manager he said they cannot listen to the call because my account is blocked. I now have to go into a branch with 3 bits of ID all because their member of staff incorrectly blocked my account. SHOCKING SERVICE, AVOID!!            
                Today I've had a really bad experience at one of their bank in Westfield , Stratford! I just wanted to put some cash money into my bank account, I was told by a member of staff to go to one machine. Me and my husband were waiting min.30-40 minutes, becaouse the queue was so long . In front of me was a gentleman who was trying for 10minutes to transfer money or I don't know what he exactly wanted, but no one helped him..and we were just waiting and waiting..until finally one lady from the staff arrived , but she wasn't to helpful and kind with him. When finally I was the next one I wanted to ask her to help me as well becouse it was the first time when I tryed to do it on the machine ,and I didn't wanted to keep staying all the people behind me while I guess who to do it. She was really , really rude! She told me "Read the screen" in front of everyone..but ok I just told her yes I read but I need help ..and she was "No you didn't" and I really don't understand how can she talk like this to a costumer! I asked her why is she so rude to me..and she was "No I'm not rude , I can't help you with your pin and security question this is not allowed" ..So everyone could think that I'm so stupid that I can't enter my pin or the answer for the security question..but no, I just asked her before the machine was asking all this to help me how to do it..I think it wasn't such a big request. I heared that she spoke with the gentleman in the same way. My opinion is they shouldn't put someone to this position who doesn't have enough patience to the costumer. If I'm talking to her in a normal way ,I expect from her this as well, not to be treated like this.            
                Having spent the last hour trying to access my online banking, without success, I have telephoned 'customer services' I could not understand a word that the person was saying. Extremely frustrating and downright annoying!THESE PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH MY MONEY!!After 35 years I'm off to Santander😠😠            
                Firstly I have to say thank you to everyone who has posted their experiences on this website. It's been our source of peace, support and encouragement. Secondly I have to say Barclays Bank shows the fact that getting rid of people and going for computers is a really bad idea hence all these negative reviews and nasty experiences that a few people I've spoken to highlights. On the 12th of January my bank account which I've held for over 25years was placed under review. As of today I have heard absolutely nothing from them. Like most others I've read, I've contacted the bank and been told go to terms and conditions. You take over an hour holding on and finally when you speak to someone they have no clue what's going on. Their staff pretend to be helpful but in reality they can't be bothered or just ignorant and ashamed to admit it. Well the ruining part is that I have a business account attached to my personal account and my business partner too has been caught in this madness He's account frozen too. Initially we thought fraud or something but as we read others stories we realised they have no clue. It's feels like the computer flags up something and that blocks all access to using the account by the account holder. All standing orders and direct debit payments are still going through.  So far from our experience nothing has been taken out and nothing said to me. The anxiety, worry, stress and  unnecessary fear cannot be put into words. Business has nearly grounded to a halt but with the help of friends,family and credit cards we're still trading. Barclays Bank seem to be doing nothing sitting on our money saying we need to provide proof of income, we have and they keep changing the story from day to day. Now, I've been fortunate to open another account ( I have excellent credit) never owed them a penny and fortunately don't pay charges never had ppi. To all of you reading this so far I've almost emptied my accounts. If it's linked to PayPal pay your friends and family your money. If you have more than 1 account with them go to the bank transfer money to the one linked to PayPal. The staff don't know what's going on they'll do it for you. If you're desperate and you have proof of payment go to the bank just before closing hours stand your ground they will have to honour the fraud team and pay you something. We did this and so far we're getting some money out. For all the stress and trauma they've given us I pray they are paid back in kind.            
                i rang the online banking with a issue to to be insulted and sworn at by the floor managers for no reason raised complaints still not been dealt with.            
                Two days IV tried to get a mini statement Friday infront of my friends it told me to contact my bank ! Joke ,Saturday  it tells me not now try later ,thank God for alternative bank card ,still confused do I still need to contact my bank hmm.            
                Having the bank account with Barclays for couple of years now and the customer service is absolutely horrible, so not helpful. Highly not recommended.            
                Missing money for the second time.  I had already been compensated for missing money the last time as it had apparenly been put on a wrong  account and was found about 10 days later.  Sureky I thought that they could not make the same mistake twice.  My alarm bells should have rung when the teller Jackie Smith made a cash advance on mty account instead of a payment.  I made sure that this was corrected and she said that the payment had been made.  Guess what the money is missing AGAIN.  I have called Barclays who tell me its going to take 14 days to resolve.  THIS BRANCH ARE EITHER COMPLETLY INCOMPENTENT OR THIEVES Either way do not let your bank receipts out of your site!!!            
                Have mortgage with Barclays for 4 years. Truly and consistently the most catastrophic customer service of any organisation. Really really awful. What more would you expect from a bank that undertakes industrial scale tax avoidance.            
                Me and my partner bank with different banks. I bank with Natwest and she banks with Barclays. When we decided to get a join account we went into the closest bank to us which was barclays and had nothing but problems ever since. To list these problems would be hard to fit on the page but here are a few... - Ive had waits up to and hour and a half on the phone trying to get online banking started. (cost of a call vary but I paid 5p per minute)- Online banking is a maze to navigate around- Customer service in store after waiting for 40 minutes sometimes due to lack of staff is dreadful and the company definitely needs and update on user friendly products!I am still with Natwest and have had zero problems. My partner waited in line at Barclays to get a bank statement and I got bored of waiting drove to Natwest getting my statement to then return to her still waiting in line. Use any bank in the world other than Barclays!            
                I have had so many fraud cases out with them, because they are obviously to incompetent to keep my money secure. Whats worse is, I have a disability that effects my mobility and everytime I have a fraud case they dont send me the paperwork and then make me walk 30 plus minutes to my branch just to get my money back and once I do they close the case and take the money back any way. This company is disgusting and shouldnt be running. DO NOT TRUST YOUR MONEY WITH THEM AT ALL.            
                WORST!!!!!!!!!!!! These people do not know what they are doing I've never had a worse experience with a card company, took them five days to credit me on something that they messed up on, and the customer service reps do not seem like they care. DO NOT USE BARCLAY CARDS            
                very rude staff as i tried to open an account and they turn me down all because i didn't have a passport or driving licence and all because i had a student card with my address and my birth certificate they still turned me down saying not enough id this is absolutely wrong what if you haven't got a passport or driving licence            
                The valuator that valued our home wasn't from the area and didn't know anything about the property. Or area he didn't even know it had a garage until I asked him if he'd looked in the garage when he was about to leave he was clearly incompitent. Now our buyers are struggling to raise the capital because they to think the property is worth 179. We renovated the property from the joists up with a brand new kitchen, boiler, roof, electrics, damp proofing and new bathroom , floors carpets and replastering. We basically rebuilt the house and the valuator didn't even bother to ask about this. Barclays say you cant appeal unless its down valued by more than 25% but in this case legal parties will be investigating it plus were contacting watchdog and trading standards.            
                Been banking with Barclays for the last 7 years. Each and every month my company pays my wage in to my account. I have a miserable £10.00 overdraft, when I asked them weather this could be increased I got a NO as a straight answer. The lady I spoke to didn't even mention I could take an insurance package with them which should automatically bring my overdraft to £250.00.Tried to apply for a small finance option (less than £900) and applied to pay them back within the year.Nevertheless they did a hard search on my credit history, which of course lowered my score and didn't accept my request.Last year I kept getting bombarded by letters they send me to apply for their credit card. After the 10th letter stating "we say yes to more and more people" I applied and guess what, my application is been rejected.I was like, fair enough if I can't get credit card from my bank I won't be able to get it anywhere else...Applied with someone else and got a card with £2000,00 limit.Barclays you're truly disgusting and you never done nothing else for me other than taking my money. Will be changing bank soon.Others please be aware!!!            
                Have a standard Barclays current account and while the account itself if perfectly fine it has become unbelievably cumbersome to manage finances with Barclays.I work in information security and consequently find immense benefits from a rooted android device; meaning I am unable to use the Barclays app at all.As such I am required to carry around another device or visit a Barclays cash point anytime I want to do something more involved with my account like a simple transfer to somebody new.  Every other bank manages to verify this without me having to leave the house - therefore there is nothing mobile about Barclays mobile banking.Have been a customer for over 3 years hoping they may eventually catch up to times but unfortunately this doesn't seem likely anymore - I am moving my current account to another provider (I am aware Halifax offer truly mobile banking).            
                Do not get any kind of insurance with Barclays, waste of time and money. Sent them my damaged phone they charged me £50 and didn't even do a good job, it came back faulty and as good as worthless. a local phone repair shop could have done 100% better in less time with less professional equipment. Wouldn't even recommend joining Barclays all together. I have 5 close family members who are with Barclays and I've already convinced them to leave. Really not worth the acknowledgement of the staff or the bank itself, basically the bank is a joke and wouldn't be surprised if they go bankrupt in the next few years.            
                Totally useless            
                I am a European Country citizen and I have recently moved to UK from a Western Country belonging to European Union, since I got a permanent and well paid job in a well known British Company. I tried to open a bank account at Barclays in UK.I drop at the Branch in town, they tell me to fix an appointment and to bring my NIN and my passport.Once at the appointment, they tell me they cannot accept my NIN because it has my previous address on it and to get an updated one. I get it, fix an appointment again. Once there, they tell me that they cannot accept this document because THE RULES HAVE CHANGED. They ask me to produce an account statement from a foreign Bank account, with my present address on it. I update this information on my foreign account through the online banking, I print it and I deliver it to Barclays. They tell me they cannot accept it because it is produced via internet and THEY WANT TO SEE THE STAMPS to prove it is original.Therefore, since the Company I work for is present on their database of acceptable and trusted Companies, they ask me to produce a reference letter written by any Company's Official, stating that I am on a permanent contract and my present address. I get a reference letter written by the Human Resources Manager, complying with all the requirements listed on the note they gave me, and I bring it to Barclays. They tell me they cannot accept it because THE PAPER IS TOO THIN and that the words "permanent contract" and my address shall be PLACED ON A DIFFERENT POINT OF THE SHEET.Astounded, I go to another Branch to see whether they are all crazy or what.The other Branch tells me that the position of the words is fine, but I cannot open a bank account because the NAME of the Company SUGGESTS I work too far away and this is not consistent with my current address. They want me to ask the Company to write another letter stating that I WORK CLOSE TO THE PLACE WHERE I LIVE. Furthermore, they told me to try to open a bank account with ANY OTHER BANK.I didn't ask for a loan or a mortgage, just to open a normal bank account.I am glad I got to know that they are completely crazy in advance enough, before having me as a Customer and putting my salary in their hands. Has the Brexit anything to do with Barclays' attitude towards new European Customers?            
                I put my visa debit card into the cash machine along with my pin number and the amount I wanted to draw out. After a while it gabe me my card and recipt  but no cash. I went into the bank explained that I am disabled and what  had  just happend   first of all they said they cant do anything for 24  hours then they said 12  days till my claim went thru. Just because they said they cant refund me            
                Unprofessionals, the stuff are like robots. The ansewers are the same for everything. If they do not know what to do they just apologise and do nothing. If they can avoid to do an extra step in order to help you they will gladly take the chance.            
                Wouldn't have even given it one star if it was an option. Spoke to them a week ago and was told I would get a phone call back later on in the day that never happened... a week later I'm calling again and have been stuck on hold for over an hour. Don't expect this from such a large bank.            
                Excellent service at Sheffield Pitstone Street.  All senior and junior members of staff dealt with my query so efficently, exemplary customer service.            
                It doesn't bode well if it takes a wait of three weeks for a bank just to open an account...            
                I opened my account on the 21/1/17 On the 30/1/17 I got this texts Your Barclays Debit Card has been temporarily deactivated to prevent fraudulent activity. I called the number they couldn't tell me what's going on !!! I said I need my money to pay the rent I was told to go into a bank and I could access my account. Got to the bank couldn't get any money out. My account had been frozen ! I needed to send proof that the money is mine. I did that in a email I've receive nothing back ! I've sent a letter too. Then I got a letter dated for the 30th January saying my account is being closed and I have to get the money out ect I got this letter on the 3rd of February I've spend around 12 hours on the phone 90% of the time on hold. The staff are rude and have no idea what is going on. I'm still waiting on information about my account. Where has my money gone !            
                I'm still on hold to a call centre in India and have been for over one hour. I can't afford to hang up as they have messed up my direct debit for my mortgage. I'll need a mortgage to cover the 'phone call!!I've been a customer for 43 years- it all started to go wrong when they reduced staff in branches to which you had direct accessibility. Absolutely appalling            
                I cannot believe a supposedly professional company can operate with this amount of negativity.I would feel ashamed to work for this shower.The name needs to be changed to INFERIOR Banking or something that reflects the service we seem to be getting.Catherine, Tanya and Vicky and all of the other people who tried to sort my problem out, your company, its telephone system and working procedures..................... ARE A JOKE....!!!!!!            
                Most appalling customer service I have received in my entire life. @SheffieldPinstoneStreet (with 2.9 google review score)First my data sensitive information was sent to a wrong address and no one could tell me where. This was a result of someone not updating my home address correctly which you would think it is imperative a bank employee to get that right.As a result of this of this I also almost missed the date of my visa application.  Just last week a trainee left unsupervised blocked my card before i confirmed it was OK and a request for a new one to be re-issued was never made until I got back in touch today.They also can't send my card with a next day delivery to rectify their atrocious service plus even though I asked to be transferred to complaints team, I was hang up on. I have no words. I am closing my account as soon as I get a new card from a different bank!            
                Bank in dark ages. Takes ages on phone to do anything with them. Staff absolutely useless in branch. Stay clear at all costs.            
                I made a payment to a wrong account . I had a look on Barclays website to what can I do . They advise to call customer service did they told me I need to go to my local branch . In the branch had to wait 45mins to tell me they cant deal with my problem as they extremely busy . In the 45 mins I saw at least 3-4 staff walking around doing nothing . I have my account with Barclays more then 5 years I think its time to cancel it .Just got my new debit card from another better bank . Thank you Barclays for the "great" help .            
                I made 2 transfers using my Euro account within the uk...... from a U.K. Account to a uk account and they charged me 35 Euro They tried telling me it was an international transfer. Fgs it's within the uk there was no exchange in currency, it was a simple transfer transaction.Total rip off            
                Shockingly poor service in branch. No counter staff in Wakefield trinity walk branch            
                fraud reported 09/01/17 - 21st jan today still can't get through to speak to anyone. two hours waiting in a queue until the battery dies on my phone. absolutely abysmal service. shocking!            
                They sent my replacement card to incomplete address despite confirming it 3 times beforehand whilst updating my address on chat and placing new card order. I had to place 2 card orders total and it took over 3 weeks for my new card to arrive.  Misinformed me about expected card delivery time abroad. They have quite a good response time on chat support though. Customer experience at my local branch has always been very good, as opposed to chat support.            
                Just spoke to Jill on the phone reference getting a mortgage appointment.  Despite us being first time buyers she was sighing and clearly irritated if we didnt know the answer to stuff on the phone.  Get somebody more personable on the phone please barclays.            
                Talk about letting young people down. Without an account they cannot work in a legit job. Barclays want them to delay their job applications until they have time to open you an account. on 19/01.2017 I was told she had to wait until 9th March as that was the first date available when an account could be opened!!!!!!!!!!!Still run like a 1960's post office in JamaicaBet they will start late opening and half day closing soon!!!            
                Went in the Lincoln branch to open my 12 year old daughter an account. The man downstairs said he'd added her name to the waiting list and to go upstairs and wait and someone would open an account for her.  I'm disabled so was a bit of a pain but I agreed as she wants her own account. After waiting upstairs for someone to become free he came over and said we didn't have an appointment so would have to make one and come back again! I asked him why we'd been put to the hassle of waiting upstairs for nothing he answered good question! He then told me to go to the Halifax and open an account instead. Very impressive customer service I must say and obviously the reputation Barclays had years ago has not changed one bit.            
                My friend reported her debit card lost and received a replacement. She later noticed a nightclub charge - she has children and grandchildren - Barclays refunded her but would not apologise for not cancelling.  Yet Barclays Credit Card said 'Contactless is cancelled automatically when reported lost or stolen'. I got the Ombudsman in, Barclays gave inane reasons, no apology and £25 compensation. What a cowboy outfit...Even then they forgot their agreement and after 7 weeks it needed another contact with the Ombudsman to process this payment.They have 'lost' the payment made by this same customer to her energy supplier, resulting in a collection agency contacting her.If they took as much trouble looking after customers as they do their managers and upper-level staff...            
                Dreadful, mockery, sham of a company, p I s s poor truly.            
                cannot get through to a human, have been trying for days. they have ruined my credit score by not updating the fact my card was paid off.            
                Barclays scores consistently at the bottom of the league tables for customer satisfaction. This accords with my own experience, one of utter frustration in trying to get them to do a simple transaction and then in owning up to this deficiencies. Not even contacting the CEO has rectified the problem, for he seems unable to order his executive team to get anything done. Clearly Barclays shareholders are getting real value from his £8m+ (2015 figure) salary.I will continue to make postings on this dreadful bank until I get satisfaction.Professor R Middleton            
                Horrible thieves!            
                Just received a letter from Barclays talking about changes to Terms & Conditions which are outlined in a booklet which I have to collect from a branch. Why was it not enclosed with the letter I ask myself. Called Barclays to ask them to send it but they won't do this!!! Why? Do customers really have to do all the leg work?? Come on Barclays if you want to tell me about changes to my T's & C's just include the information you are referring to. I really don't want to have to take this to the Ombudsman.            
                I had an appointment,when i get there on time,they said the staff is not in today! Never heard of such thing before,a bank staff treat customers appointment like that! Then the customer service bring me to another assistant who said i cant help you,you have to ring them! I rang them then,after about half an hour waiting and explaining and security check and telling them what i need over the phone then they said i have to come to branch. Feel like im a ball being kicked around by them!I go to HSBC straight away,i swear im gonna closed  all my barclays account and never use them again!            
                Banking with Barclays has ruined my credit score and caused me to have so much unnecessary debt. When you try to clear your debt or get them to fix their errors the push you to go throught debt management companies. I can't wait to close my account with them.            
                Please be warned that even if you are not their customer they will perform searches on your credit file and damage your score as they can't be bothered to do proper checks to prevent fraud. Their fraud investigation team is complete shambles.I will have nothing to do with this disgraceful company.            
                personal accounts and business accounts they have always looked after me            
                I received a closure account notice. I have identified this as identity theft as I have no account with Barclays. Tried to contact the fraud team and there was up to one hour waiting time.   I tried to call 5 times but to no avail.  I went into Hounslow High Street branch and they were useless as well. The uninterested staff dialled the same number as I dialled and left me to wait for the phone to be answered whilst he served other customers.   1 hour and 10 minutes on hold I gave up. Left the branch disgusted as within that one hr the guy never even came back to me just to check.  I also asked him how easy it is to open an account with banks. He said it was not and that the account this thief had made had been closed. So why generate a bank account number and sort code if it was not opened in the first place? And why despite of recognising this is a fraud hence they closed the account did this impact my credit score?  Also on one side they have about 3 chairs and tablets and on the wall it said, "it takes minutes to open an account."  So it means it is easy to open an account and yet they spend so much time dealing with fraud claims because of no one else's fault but them. They are actually encouraging criminals to do just that.            
                I had a payment declined on my card earlier today and a text was sent to advise me of the fact, I responded that the purchase was genuine as requested. I called the company and the card was put through again but once again declined. I telephoned Barclaycard and they confirmed payment had been made. In trying to sort out who was in fact telling the truth I called Barclaycard a further three times, going through security five times, left queuing for an hour in total finally to be told they could (or would) do nothing. Overcoming the linguistics of Mumbai, well that is another story.            
                I have a friend who is very hard of hearing and he needed to know the balance on his account and query the recent transactions, so I telephoned the bank for him whilst he stood beside me.  They were O.K., but we gave up because my friend couldn't hear well enough to answer all the questions.  I popped into the branch to pay some money into his account, but had forgotten to bring in his debit card.  I apologized to the Cashier that I had not brought his card in and could not remember his account number, but explained that I knew his address and post code and advised that his account was at that branch, so that was the sort code side of it sorted.  The lady refused to take the money that I wanted to pay into his account, even though I stressed that I knew his balance (which I also quoted) and that the money needed to go in to bring the account back into credit because he would incurr further charges if the money didn't go in.  The Cashier looked at me in disgust, as if to imply that I was 'in the wrong' and that she clearly dis-approved of this.  I had done nothing wrong, but was being treated like I was causing trouble.  I advised that this was not acceptable service and asked to speak to the Manager.  I was asked to take a seat and wait to see a Manager, which was not a problem and then I was summonsed into a private room.  This was O.K. because, at least, they were good enough to give me their time, so credit to them on that score,  but when I repeated myself again; stressing that all I wanted to do was pay cash into my friend's account to put his account in credit (waving the cash, as I said this, to prove that I was not a villain!), and I had his name, address and post code and even had his date of birth, if necessary, she explained that their computers were programmed to stop them taking payments without the account number too.  I complained that this was not a problem with other banks and had not been a problem before when I'd paid money into another branch of Barclays.  The Manager of the Wroxham branch, Joanne, tried to insist that it would have been a problem at another branch and, in fact, with other banks.  This was not true.  All she could advise was that it was to do with data protection, which did not convince me, since I was not asking for any of his credentials and, if anything, how is it protecting the customer when they are asking me to get his personal account number?!; surely, that's encouraging me to steal his credentials and can increase the temptation for identity theft?!, so that didn't convince me, so I asked her for this excuse in writing.  Being complacent, conceited and feeling that she was better than others, she refused to give anything in writing.  She was quite unpleasant at this point.  Maybe I'd 'took the wind from her sails'.She kept insisting that the branch would not take the money, even though I had his credentials, then asked if I banked with Barclays, which was irrelevant.  Understandably, at that point, I was angry because they would continue to charge him daily for being overdrawn and I responded 'Did I f.....' and that I did 'not give a s.... about Barclays'.  At that same moment, I got up to leave, as the conversation was over and I'd vented my anger.   At no point was I aggressive or abusive towards her or any member of staff, for that matter.  As I gestured to get the door handle to open the door, she too stood up to open it for me to let me out.  Now, remember that it was myself that had got up to leave, yet as I walked out of the little room into the central customer area of thebranch, where the rest of the staff were - hungrily looking on for drama, I hasten to add (and this was not my imagination) she said to my back, as I walked across the open area of the branch towards the exit 'Now, I'd like you to leave the branch....'., trying to show off to the other serving staff members on the floor, as if to imply that She was telling Me to go!, to make herself look big and powerful, when that Was Not the case at all!  She irritated me further at that point because she was deliberately berating me, in an attempt, perhaps, to give her the satisfaction of my entertaining other staff members with a volatile response from me, so  I calmly replied that I was glad to leave and calmly walked out, but she then said, again to my back, as I walked off (as she'd managed to bring in her captive audience of staff and customers) 'I'm not being spoken to like that.'  This was purely to boost her own ego and imply to the others that I'd been abusive to her.  She knew, very well, that I did not verbally abuse her and should have used her common sense and professionalism to remain tactful and graciously see me out of the door, maybe with a polite apology because she knew my language was a gesture of anger at the bank and not her, but she was so complacent, she took the opportunity to villainize me for her image.  That's NOT the way to treat, decent people, who do not anger or swear easily and are, in fact, a credit to society.            
                Stupid entry policies. They don't accept NHS letters, Student Loan Company letters, pay-slips, nothing that a 20 years old teenager can have. I mean do they really expect me to pay housing bills when I'm a full time student? Went to branch 4 times for opening an account but apparently there is something missing every time, even tho I took every single document with me, even the unnecessary ones. Joined to Lloyds EASILY on the first try and I'm really happy with them.            
                Ive banked with Barclays since the '60's. They used to be unbeatable for customer care until they decided that customers no longer mattered to them and they got rid of their customer oriented staff about 20+ years ago, since then they have deteriorated out of all recognition. Foreign CS staff - Ive nothing against them, but at least make sure they can speak understandable English! what was wrong with the ones they sacked?Ive just received a few pfishing messages recently from Barclays & Nat West (I dont bank with Nat West) but guess which one bothered to confirm they were actually pfishing messages - yes, the one I dont bank with. Looks like they will now be losing a loyal, long standing customer. Wake up Barclays before others come to a similar conclusion.  At last, they have finally (after numerous notifications) issued an automated acknowledgement -so there ARE real people there. If you are an on line customer, you do have the offer of free 'Kaspersky' and 'Safemoney', so all is not lost really (just almost).            
                I joined Barclays a year ago after my friends recommended it and I wanted a fresh bank account after getting married. I have had nothing but problems with them. Whenever I pay for anything with my card either online or in person, they block it. You then ring up confirm it's you and get sent a new bank card. I have been with them for 18 months and have had 9 bank cards with them because they are constantly blocking it whenever I try to buy anything or withdraw money because it is flagged as fraudulent. My rent is  month it declines my lament, I have to ring up and confirm it's me. The only way I can pay my rent is with two 200 transaction one after the over to the exact same company so instead of detecting to identical payments as errors they detect one single payment as fraudulent. They're ridiculous. The final straw is tonight they have blocked me from my account in their words to protect the bank, because I didn't sound like myself on the phone. Even though I passed all my security questions, they said I need to go into branch with two forms of ID to confirm it's me it is absolutely ridiculous all the fkng about I have to do every single month with this bank. It's the final straw now! I am leaving them and going to a decent bank . Please avoid at all costs you will have nothing but trouble with them.            
                Barclays needs to drastically improve their Customer care. My Mother recently died she had 2 accounts with Barclays, despite my sister & myself taking all the necessary paperwork into the local branch where Mom banked we had heard nothing after 5 weeks. We have received no update, no letter of condolence, nothing. I telephoned to find out what was hapenning, as we wanted the cash, was told it could take up to 12 weeks to process as Moms accounts were dormant.My Mom had opened accounts in all the local banks, these were all dormant, yet they had managed to sort it out. Take a bow Santander, Nat West,West Brom. BS, Aviva & Friends Life, you all knock spots of Barclays.            
                BARCLAYS IS A waste of money time and nerves this bank is, I have made an appointment for mortgage with Anna Beales at 65 Hight Street Camberley Barclays branch< I have been travelling for 1.5 hour to get to this branch and she just didn't turn up! They didn't even bother to call me to say that she is not there... lol.            
                I moved home in Feb 2016 and went to my local Barclays branch to notify them of my new address.I use Barclays debit account purely for private internet purchases. I transfer about £500 monthly and by the end of the month I am usually left at about £100. From their perspective i cannot / should not be considered as a safe credit customer. They straight away offered direct debit services such as insurance of all sorts and offered me a loan of £20,000. They did not even mention the interest rates. I had to refuse the offer several times in order to make it clear that i do not require a loan and that i came in just to notify them of change of my address.            
                A MONTH AGO, I remortgaged my house and got some money from it to pay back some debt. Barclays saw this as fraudulent money and  my account was put "under review" in other words frozen and NOBODY decided to INFORM ME about it. I had to call up the next day when my I couldn't access my online banking. I was informed EVERYTHING IS FINE and my money is safe, my direct debits / standing order WOULD GO THROUGH. and my account would be unlocked for the 5th of December.Since i couldn't access any of my account details, I had to take time off WORK, to see my statement in branch, least to say the branch staff couldn't care less of my situation and speaking to customers service on the phone didn't help. I look at my statement. All my direct debits bounced back including my first time mortgage payment. Furious. I asked what i can do the branch staff just talk me to call the fraud department and didn't want to help me in any form. The queue was over 1hr 30 mins and after speak to them they said they can't do anything because my account is under review and no more comments.I have given all the information and given on how i got the money, the bank statement clearly shows who paid me the money. The funny part is one of the direct debits that bounced was for the first mortgage payment from the same people who provided me the loan which you can clearly see in my account.Disgusted ,after wasting a whole day i got nowhere. What's worst my November's salary was put in and i couldn't access it.Had to borrowed money from family put money into another bank account i have and next day i came in branch ( again had to take time off work) and cancelled all direct debits and standing order and had to call my providers and re-setup direct debits and make payment over card.  in order to avoid going into arrears due to my bank lying to me. First time in my life i;ve missed payments, probably ruined my perfect credit score too.I wrote a complaint the same day and i receive an existing complaint track it reference and a letter to say i will get a response by the 1st of January which i know is a lie because i have tried to call the department and i think they are closed for Christmas.I keep calling every week from this point to only find that the fraud department is ever so busy minimum 1hr 30 mins to answer phone calls to tell me same thing. My account is under review, what the hell are you guys reviewing after i gave evidence on where i got the money from and you can clearly say the same guys tried to take payment back?TODAY, i receive an email that i have fees over unpaid direct debits, interesting they became unpaid because YOU TOLD ME they would all go through but decided to block them.Now, i got paid yesterday but i had to use that money to pay back family i borrowed money from last week and pay the bills. I have not bought a single family member a Christmas present thanks to your lies and having to write this review to due frustration.My trust in Barclays being a customer over 12 years has just gone down the drain. If i was told from the beginning that payments would not go through i would have made arrangements but telling would go through and then lie to me.I am not spending my Christmas calling the fraud department to wait over 2 hours again and to hear the same thing again. Thank you for making this the most stressful end of year experience for anyone ever!            
                They are rude and incredibly imrtrusive. Had to give security ingot 8 times to same girl. I was on the phone for over an hour two days running then I get a lecture by "James" on global banking system. All I wantedto do was pay my overdraft. The he stopped my card as he did not believe who I was.2nd incident -I had to drive to bank and provide "proof". He then demanded I identify my bank manager after he gave the branch ID. He refused to release my card as it looked Fraudulent, as I buy old coins. He told me he "Could do anything he wanted as he was a very important person in Barclays and he could block my accounts if he wished at any time if he did not like my tone or complaint!" This was listened into by my manager who has known me 13 years.I receiced £160 compensation from Barclays and the person was apparently free to consider his position with all the free time he now enjoys. They sacked him. Indian call centres are full of  self important panjandrams.....            
                This is a dreadfull web design ,unresponsive, full of stuff showing the poor user just how clever the perpetators of this site think they are .The designers (Ha Ha ) clearly have not asked the users  what they want from an online banking facility. Had I no option but to use this rubbish I would be long gone to another bank Come on Barclays get rid of this load of rubbish and adopt some common sense into the design of this facility,It should be easy peasy to use uncluttered and quick,most of us have hot the time or inclination to spend watching the the wheel of death spinning around.            
                terrible service - complete nightmare            
                My stepfather had an investment account with Barclays Wealth in Jersey for decades - at least 30 years. He died in April 2015. My executor was told by Barclays that only English probate was required to release the funds. That was obtained, only to be told that Jersey probate was also required. A request for an explanation as to why we now need Jersey probate ( which will result in extra costs and delays) has not even been replied to, after a month. The contempt with which the banks treat us when they have to give us something back has not changed one iota since 2008. I'm anti-Brexit, but if it means the City goes abroad - good riddance. Parasites.            
                Told bank that I did not want online banking under any circumstances and if I did I go in to branch and sort it then in March found out it had been set up (not by me) then money went out of account been trying to get money back since gone through all stages told money would be there today and boom nothing in account with Xmas less than a week away Xmas cancelled in our house thanks barclays            
                My card was suspended for some unknown reason (possibility of fraud). Contacted Barclays online using Pin Sentry - was asked to phone due to technical difficulties. After at least an hour and a half of being sent from one department to another, managed to speak to someone in India who was barely understandable. Went through many security questions and was asked if I had made any recent transactions. When I asked my wife for to hand me a receipt I had from a fuel station, I was told that I could no longer be spoken to and in future not to ask for help! When I asked for an explanation the person on the phone said "Sorry it's a bad line you are breaking up" and the phone went dead! I gave up hope as by this time I'd spent over 2 hours trying. Because of this I am losing sales on Amazon as they have suspended my seller account until my card details are 'updated' and I cannot receive any payments from them. Looking at some other recent reviews here, it seems to be the 'norm' for Barclays. I've been with Barclays for around 30 years but will be leaving now. I've never experienced such rudeness and bad service from a 'Helpline'.            
                I've recently tried to purchase a plane ticket with my barclays debit card. Now, it had happened to me before (several times might I add) that when I tried to make even a slightly hefty online purchase, my card gets "temporarily deactivated for suspicion of fradulent activity"; obliging me to call their customer service and answer a load of questions as well as wasting 20 minutes of my time. This once was no exception, of course. I received a notificiation stating I should contact them, and slightly disgruntled, so I did. First, I was connected to a lady working at the customer service line and she said my answers weren't satisfactory and I should go to a barclays branch with two forms of identification to reactivate my card. I politely told her that it was not a possibilty as I was abroad and I really needed to use my card; it was connected to the only account I could use overseas. She unapolagetically dismisses me, leaving me to call yet another customer service agent. The person I'm on the phone with makes me go through the security questions once again, only to put me on hold for 30 minutes as he tried to "consult a colleague in the fraud department". After the 30th minute, my patience ceased completely; and I called another customer service agent. This lady was actually quite nice so bless her sould and I am genuinely sorry for her to have to work for such an absolute disgrace of a company. She told me to download the barclays app and contact someone through there, so I would't have to go through security again and the problem could be identified to the agent. I called them again, and the man I was connected to was an absolute nightmare; so much so that my brain cannot even begin to comprehend how such a major company could hire such an unenthusiastic, unhelpful, malicious person. He made me go through security again (bear in mind by this time i have been dealing with this for 2 hours) asking me questions regarding my purchases over a week ago (which i answered correctly and precisely). When it came to what direct debits go through my account, I asked for a moment to ask my daughter as she has a david lloyds membership whose cost I wasn't sure about. Now, here is the good part (to the barclays boneheads that might be reading this: that was sarcasm) he has the audacity to say something along the lines of "at this point in time,  I have no choice but to suspend your account. I do not think you are the account holder since you have to ask somebody else." Yes, this is the extent of reliable and helpful customer service experience you should expect to get at barclays. He, on ABSOLUTELY NO GROUNDS - I had answered every question correctly and thoroughly, explained my urgent sitaution and so forth- SUSPENDS MY ACCOUNT, LEAVING ME PENNILESS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY FOR 10 DAYS. Aferwards, I tried to call another barclays agent only to be met with the knowledge that my suspension cannot be removed unless I visit a barclays branch, followed by the brilliant advice (again, a sarcastic remark) that I could borrow money from someone. Yes, how did I not think of that penultimate solution to heed all my prayers and needs? In conclusion though, the independent wasn't wrong to name barclyas the worst bank in terms of customer service for 23 years in a row. It is an absolute shame that such a company can continuously keep disregarding their customers and treating them like nothing more than assets. I guess it goes without saying that I will no longer keep my money at barclays and warn everyone I know about the horrendous service they will be met with should they fall into their trap like I did. For your sake, I advise you cut all ties from this company at once as such an essential service should not be given to the hands of such unprofessionalism.            
                I've banked with Barclays for 30 years and every time I need to call them I wish I didn't.This applies to current, savings, business and credit card accounts.  Just lucky I don't have a mortgage with them too.Customer services can always find a way to ensure you never get exactly what you need from being unable to pay full balances, to being unable to update addresses, to getting me on telephone banking so I can do these things, to calling back when they promise to or getting things done on time.I reported fraudulent activity on my card for thousands of pounds and they even made that so difficult that I never got the money back.To put it bluntly - they suck. At banking, at customer service, at being helpful, at  being efficient. Pretty much everything. One by one I've moved my money and my families money elsewhere - because if there is a way to mess things up for you (whilst charging you for it in the process) Barclays will find a way.Avoid like the plague - your money would be safer in a tin can than with these jokers.            
                On the 10th of November I paid my gas and electricity bill via card payment. My supplier informed me the bill was paid on this day and I owed nothing. I was utterly shocked to discover this morning that I was overdrawn on my account and barclays have left me with -2.22. I contacted them immediately to be told that they had transfered the gas and electricity money back into my account on the 17th November without informing me this was happening. Now I have no direct debits and I certainly didn't notice that the bill money was paid back into my account. I don't constantly check my balance as barclays text my balance on a Friday evening. So my weekly balance never made me think I had anymore or any less in my account so always seem correct according to what I've spent.According to my bank the gas and electricity supplier didn't take the money on the 10th even though my supplier has confirmed they did, they have taken the money from my account over a month later and now a week before Christmas I have nothing.What money I had left in the account was travel for work and Christmas food.Not once was I informed that a major company southern electricity hadn't taken the payment for my bill. Which I find extremely bizarre as I was under the impression that when a payment is made it will be debited from my account and can take 3 working days for the company to see this on my account with them.My supplier has confirmed it was cleared on the day I paid this bill. So customer service complete waste of time at barclays informs me the supplier had 3 to 10 days to collect the money then to be told 15 days from my account to then be told 7 days from my account and barclays then put the money back into my account confused yet oh it gets better .....So according to barclays they put the bill money back into my account on the 17th November because this major company hasn't collected the bill payment and not once was I informed. so my situation I was not aware this money was credited back to my account it didn't flag up on my balance but a month down the line this company has now asked for this payment and I now have nothing for Christmas. I have no issues paying my bills it's important but what the hell is barclays playing at??? I authorised a payment on the 10th November I have not instructed my bank to take any payment after this so what's all this 7 days nonsense about the bank have messed up not me and now I'm being punished !!!! Why the hell was I not informed of this it's not my fault I demanded them put the payment back into my account but apparently they can't do this! at least I could then have some payment plan for there cock up happy Christmas barclays !!!!            
                Stolen a vulnerable disabled persons money as they suspected fraud, Shown no evidence of fraud and will refuse to answer any questions. Was on hold for 2 and a half hours before I got through to a Indian fraud call centre who then shout r takes 5 days to investigate then hung up! On going problem for months now you take a vulnerable disabled persons money there only income is benefits! Worst bank ever!In contact with FSA and National Papers.            
                So, I have not had any online banking since 2014, Despite endless hours spend running up my phone bill and feckless staff in branch, which now has got rid off nearly all staff in favour of 6 computerised bank machines (this in a City of all places!) now populated by 2 confused members of staff and older people milling about wondering why their bank has been closed down in all but name,I have complained about lack of access to internet banking but after last 'escalation' which resulted in team sending me mocking letter and 60 refund which has not covered cost of phone calls I have now given up and set up an account with another bank,On one occasion I rang the internet banking team in desperation whilst travelling and needing to log in and transfer money in an emergency, the member of staff kept telling me to press keys on keyboard which I know don't do anything and every time I did this the banking 'team' were applauding and clapping in background clearly as some form of sport,I have been a Barclays customer since a child and remained loyal long after I should have,You are the worst kind of scum, and don't deserve my business,The loathing I now have for you is only equalled by my desire to change banks            
                I will never be going back to my local bank again, I'm leaving barclays which I have been with your year's because of this experience. You need to give your staff customer care training because there attitudes are unfriendly and hostile, this used to be a good bank.            
                I instructed Barclays to cancel direct debits from BT several months ago. Barclays have ignored my instructions and allowed BT to debit my account with charges that BT have admitted they raised fraudulently.I had informed BT that if they proceeded with charges against me, I would take them to court for fraud. BT acknowledged that they were fraudulent in raising these charges against me and rescinded the charges.Despite this, BT have charged me and Barclays accepted the charges.Barclays are a disgrace to the banking sector and I intend moving my account and leaving my comments on all the social media sites I can find.            
                Approached a young lady on the shop floor in Milton Keynes with a simple  and polite query. For no reason she was short, shrift and arrogant. Diabolical attitude. Thought she was Prescilla Queen of The Desert. Cut me off half way through speaking and looked the other way. Never had such a rude experience in my life. Your customers have money invested in you.Tomorrow they might not have. Work on staff attitude. Indian call centre is generally a lot better with customer interaction. This country is going down the pan.            
                Was on hold for over 1hour 30mins before i had to hang up in frustration.Disgusting service.            
                Barclays customer service online banking has become the worst customer service. They talk to the customers like computers and have no sense of flexibility and understanding not even in relation of an injured person. The fraud dept accidentally blocked my card without warning. i'd previously explained that the transaction made was fine. The fraud dept said they took note of that and everything was fine and sorted. Out of the blue, they cancel my card while injured (can't walk) and in need of food shopping. They told me to go to the bank and sort it out there! It seems British institutions nowadays act like computers with no empathy and no understanding of the customers' needs and situations even in case of illness and injury.            
                I went to my local branch, in Devizes, where I have had an account for over 50 years. I wanted to transfer money from one account to another (a transaction I often do) I had my bank statement with me, as usual. The teller whom I've never seen before would not do the transaction as I had no form of identity. I was only transferring money & if she had bothered to look it up she would have seen the 2 accounts. Anyway she said come back with your bank card which I did - another round trip of 10 miles - she then asked me if I owned my house! This in front of other people & is of no concern of hers. In all an unpleasant experience & if it wasn't too complicated I would have cancelled my accounts with them immediately.            
                Everyone one comes into contact with through customer service at Barclays are incompetent, rude, and quite frankly useless. They lack expertise on anything and everything you need help with and they are extremely poor in their ability to service and handle their customers. The waiting time to get through to customers service is seldom less than 30 minutes at which point they tell you someone else will have to call you back because they know nothing about the subject you are calling about. They are careless about your personal data and details and are quite frankly the worst bank I have ever banked with. I am switching all of my banking to another bank, I have had enough of Barclays and I would warn anyone and everyone I know from banking with Barclays. It's a disgrace.            
                All my money went in a Barclays new account. Received my cards and PIN number and internet banking details arrived. Wages paid into it and the weekend is here. BOOM!They shut down my account stipulating fraud without good cause and frozen my funds until I receive my letter what to do next. No funds to feed my kids or pay my bills and do the Christmas shopping. OMG.            
                This bank is ridiculous. They block your account whenever they want and you the customer will end up in bad credit because you wouldn't be able to pay your bills. If you give them a call the customer service is extremely awful, they have no idea what they are talking about. The FCA should close this worthless incompetent bank. Guess what I am moving not only my bank but I am advising any family or friend I know to close their accounts immediately and move to better banks.            
                In my recent weeks both my business account and my personal account debit cards have been repeatedly blocked  -  despite the fact that I have thousands of pounds in the accounts.  When I telephoned Barclays to ask why my cards have been blocked, I was told that it was because of a "fallback".  When I asked what a "fallback" was I told that that "....it could be almost anything..."!!!I have written to Barclays to complain using their online "Secure Message" system and have been told to expect an answer "within 48 hours".  That was three weeks ago and I still have no answer.Is this what Barclays call "customer service"?            
                I have been banking with Barclays since 2005, recently I have noticed that they are becoming untrustworthy and I am strongly considering moving to another bank. I transferred £400 from my account to my girlfriends account. The money was debited on my account but the recipient never received it. I phoned Barclays, the confirmed that my girlfriend’s account was rightly entered on the system by me but they seem not to be able to trace where they sent my money to.  The customers service was awfully unbelievably appalling. They kept me on the phone for over an hour only to tell me that if the money is lost they will try to trace it and see if they can recover it. I was expecting them to refund me as the mistake was from their end and not from me. My girlfriend needed the money to pay for her flight, as a result of Barclays mistake she had to miss out travelling with her best friends. As I am typing this now they still haven’t refunded my money nor traced where they sent my money to. If you are considering open an account, please stay away from Barclays            
                Had fraud on my Debit Card totalling £370 spent through River Island.Was initially refunded the money until two weeks later I had to sign a form saying the transactions were fraudulent.Called up Barclays as the money was once again taken from my account. Was informed that the transactions were deemed as legitimate because I had purchased from River Island legitimately in the past. Was fobbed off on the phone, constantly being told that the fraud team have clearly said that the transactions were legitimate.Contacted River Island and was informed that the bank had not even contacted them to query the transactions.So Barclays can somehow deem fraud to be legitimate simply because I had purchased from River Island in the past.I am now waiting for a response from a Manager after putting in a complaint            
                Barclays Bank have got to be 1 of the worst banks ever!!! Their customer service team are absolutely useless, training in this company must be nonexistent!!!! Not once have I ever had my situation resolved or anyone on the other end sounding slightly interested in doing so!! They are rude and intrusive into personal circumstances, if I had a choice I would most definitely not bank with them!! Frustrated and angry yet again to my requests not being met satisfactory!!!            
                In 2010 we wanted to buy a 600 year-old timber-framed house, for £540,000, with a £160,000 loan from Barclays. We are a retired couple, this was to be our "retirement home". Barclays wanted the survey done by ESurv, a connected company, and I was therefore concerned that we would not genuinely get a real survey. I did not want just a valuation to protect the Bank's investment....we needed to protect our investment too. The Bank assured us in writing that it would be a proper full survey, so we went ahead. We trusted the Bank, whom our family have used for some 70 years.  The survey was negligently done, we sued ESurv and recovered damages after more than 5 years of legal hell. However, because of the way UK law calculates method of damages, we are still suffering £300,000 or so net loss on what we have had to spend to prevent the house falling down. We have since discovered that (a) ESurv do not have a "normal" office, but only a first floor office hidden away over a shopping centre in Kettering, and this office is not accessible to the public (b) they have a huge provision of millions of pounds, in their accounts,  to cover professional indemnity claims (c) directors are, or were, connected to what one might term "cut -price" legal services companies (d) the surveyor organised by Barclays was at the house, according to our Vendor, between one and two hours, nearer one hour than two". A proper survey would have taken at least a day..even his report was written up the same day as the "survey"! We feel the Bank misled us, and really only organised a valuation to protect their investment. It certainly did not protect us. We have tried a claim to the Banking Ombudsman, but got nowhere. We have suggested to the Bank that morally they owe us the £300K shortfall, but that we would be happy with them cancelling our loan of just £160K, We have utterly failed to gain any satisfactory response from the Bank whose conduct we feel has been careless, and immoral. May I suggest people do NOT let Barclays organise their "survey". Do NOT let ESurv anywhere near you. We consider this whole mess entirely Barclay's fault.            
                Barclays is the worst bank, their customer service team are rude and dnt know what they're tlking about. Fraud always happens on people's accounts, they charge you for their mistakes, you cant open the app or take out any money and any cash point. I've had Numerous of problems with this bank and i'm finally leaving. I didnt want to leave it because sme of my friends are with barclays but now am fed up and we're all fed up.            
                Called on Sunday and it appeared that it was an overseas call center. Took me an hour to speak to the supervisor, the staff member told me to remain patient. I asked them to call me back as I wanted to lodge a complaint and send out a new card. They didn't do either. Avoid! Communication in the company is awful!            
                I am a disabled person who walks with a cruch and have asthma and heart problems.Although I was not well I had to make a payment with cash. I went to Kingsland Branch to pay Card account.  As I am disabled I was told to stand on the side of the questions and when a counter becomes available the cashier would call me. I have been doing this way since I was told by the staff at Kingsland Branch London. As I only had till 21st of this month to pay and I could not go until today dye to breathing problems. I went and stood by the place where I was told to wait on the side of the que. To my astonishment the cashier pointed at me and said go to the back of the que and tell the last person to safe my place in the que and when my turn comes I would be seen. I replied this is what I was told by staff before. The cashier stated that the new manager have withdrawn this assistance and we cannot no longer accomodate in this way. Further to this I was told find a sitting place. I walked away in disgust and could not believe that a bank manager could be so cruel on disabled people that she has made it her policy to discriminate against disabled people.  As I was leaving the bank I seen a member of staff standing. I asked him if I he could tell me the managers name. He gave me the name and I asked him why has the policy of disabled people asistance changed. He replied this is what the manager has stated. I asked him is this the policy if Barclay,  he replies maybe. I stated to him that if this is the case i am very sure that the discrimination disability act is being broken. He stated what is that. When he stated that I felt it would be pointless to talk to a person who didn't even know that a law existed  to discriminate against disabled people. I requested if I could see the manager for a minute as I stated I feel I and many other disabled people are being discriminate due to disability/ health issues. Without finding out he said you may have to wait a while. As my breathing was becoming a problem,  I stated that I will contact Barclay by phone and see whether Barclay have a policy which discriminates against disabled people or not and also I am going to make an official complaint against Barclays Kingsland Branch for discriminating against disabled people. I called Barclays and talked to a customer service personnel by the name of steve. He went through security questions and asked how I could be assisted today. I told him what happened. He was disgusted in the way I was treated and said if my father was treated like yourself I would not put up with this type of customer service from Barclay although I am working for Barclay. Due to this now I am delayed in paying my card account. He stated that until this matter is resolved he would put on the notes that a late payment on my card would not trigger a late paying fine. He also escalated the matter  and gave me the relevant timescales of when this issue will be investigated and hopefully resolved. I feel to be ill and disabled is becoming a crime. Have we lost all of our senses. A Manager pushing discriminatory policies should be moved from her post and given maybe a job away from public services. It's people like her in the posistion of authority abusing her posistion and I would call this institutional abuse as she is a manager. I request Barclay to immediately remove her from her position. Also to Clear sign showing disabled, a priority disabled cashier desk,  like they have for business banking. If these tasks are not done I feel Barclay is no longer for me. SHAME SHAME SHAME YOU MANAGER OF KINGSLAND ROAD BRANCH LONDON. Remember my words maybe you may become disabled and ill one day. What will happen to you, you should ask this question to your self so maybe you change now.            
                Barclays contacted me on Nov advising me my account was "being migrated". What this actually meant is my interest free overdraft was about to change to one where I would pay a few pounds every day I was in it.They gave me 2 months to get my affairs in order, right before Christmas. I explained that as a low earner I would struggle to pay the balance off in 2 months (I mean they CAN see my account - they do know this) could I have a 2 month extension - 4 month notice period in total, to give me an actual chance of paying this off and not incurring charges. As I have been a customer for 10 years, and I do, "manage my account really well"The short answer, after being passed from department to department, including a "specialised migration department set up especially to support customers with this type of account" who knew nothing really about it, ending up at the complaints department, the short answer was "no. Go screw yourself, we are not acting illegally so....no"Fair enough I suppose but I have some issues with the way I was dealt with.1. I do think that squeezing low earners to the point they get further into debt is a problem in this country. They know, they can see from my account, that 2 months notice isn't possible, even if I really tighten my belt, but 4 months, just, would be. So, why not give me the extension? why make a change, out of the blue, with very little notice that they can see will screw me over?2. Well I'll tell you why...I was basically advised that my only good option was to take out a Barclays loan! (Shocker). Then, this big juicy carrot was dangled right in front of me "actually, because you're such a good, valued customer (insert joke here) you COULD just borrow enough to clear your overdraft.... but....looking at this...and we don't offer this to just everybody you know...it looks like you could borrow £25,000".  !!!!. I mean sorry, but is this not the cause of that little blip we had called the recession?! I have just gone part time, I make £766 per month, but "oooh yeah look, you can have 25 grand to spend on ANYTHING you want"... disgraceful. Shocking really. Thankfully I told them thanks but no thanks. But it felt a bit like praying on the weak.3. And this bit is more creepy I think. I spoke to maybe 4 advisors. They were all very nice. On reflection maybe too nice. Each one of them went out of their way to say things like "I ageee with you, I think it's rotten what Barclays have done, I personally feel really bad for you, I'm so sorry this has happened to you, if it was up to me I'd let you have the extension". All of them, reflecting back, like a script. Oh I agree I'd love to help you but the big nasty bank says no. Hold on, you work for the bank! Making "the bank" seem like this distant, omnipotent oppressor like some kind of wizard of oz character is definitely a tactic Barclays are employing, and I do not like it.4. Finally, "no problem I thought, I have a Barclay card for rainy days, I don't use it much but it's got a good limit, and great rates on money transfers, I'll do a money transfer and pay maybe £20 for the privalage of clearing my overdraft and paying off small monthly instalments for 12 months, no interest, sorted". Except Barclay card had shut my Barclay card. Because of infrequent use "you were sent a letter". I wasn't. So great. Cheers for that Barclays. Can I reopen the card? Nope, can I re-apply? Yeah, but we don't grant new customers money transfers. Can you not see that I'm not actually a new customer, in fact I had my Barclay card for 3 years and never missed a payment? Nope. In the end I've cleared it with an NBMA card I also thankfully have for rainy days.To conclude, I'm a good person. I'm pretty good with money, I've no debts (except my overdraft, but it's been interest free for 10 years so I've just never got in the Habit of not being in it). Barclays sent me a really cold letter, not even personalised to the issues I'd raised, just a "sorry you're unhappy but out terms and conditions clearly state....". I aim to fully clear my overdraft then I'll be making a "migration" of my own, to another bank.            
                Gave me a graduate overdraft account of £1,500 interest free for up to a year, followed by an interest free limit of £1,000 the year after. Sent a generic letter advising 'graduate accounts are changing'. Called up to ask what that meant to me - advised my limit would go from £1,500 to £1,000 as it should after a year. Also advised that due to the changes, my limit would be increased to £2,000 as per the 'changes'. I was informed incorrectly. Turns out it doesn't change. So no I have no money to eat, or pay for my depression medication. I contacted FOS who are trying to help. Unlike Barclays who just keep saying 'they're looking into it'. I work in a high end insurance company. If one of my clients was advised wrongly of cover, that would be classed as a breach and we would make sure that client is in no worse position than they should be at any point.Again, unlike Barclays who don't seem to give a toss if their customers can't afford to eat due to their mistake.            
                Very bad customer service. I am not satisfied            
                Have a £350,000 with a £24,000 Mortgage,  a £44,000 salary,Spent £30,000 on credit cars, decided to clear the cards by remorgaging,  told no because 2 payments have been missed on a loan then told I wasn't eligible for financial products not even an extension to my overdraft,  despite having savings of £760,000 in a pension fund 25% I have access to. Phoned Barclays to tell them I will be paying it off. Told I had to make a payment promise for the 15th November,  despite paying in my salary on the 15th for the past 36 years. If I do not pay on the 15th part of my overdraft limit will be cut. Said I will be paying in a few thousand pounds to clear the debt. To add insult to injury they said they will ring me when money is payed in so they can advise me on Barclays investments. Avoid.  they are ruthless,  unhelpful,  unflexable and evil. LOL Barclays Values, Respect. We respect and value those we work with, and the contribution that they make. ...Integrity. We act fairly, ethically and openly in all we do. ...Service. We put our clients and customers at the centre of what we do. ...Excellence. We use our energy, skills and resources to deliver the best, sustainable results. ...Stewardship.Oh they forgot to add supporters of LIBOR            
                Got told my card was blocked for fraud, the guy on the phone told me the money would be refunded the same day and that my new card would arrive within 2 days, then got a text on the day it was meant to arrive saying that the card had only just been dispatched after being told it would be with me on that day?? also money still wasn't refunded... Then rung Barclays to be put on hold several times to then be told that the man who originally rung me never left any notes on my account about the fraud and he told me the completely wrong things about the card and my money.            
                im using online statement with barclays, for personal instance, i need bank statement so i came over, wait 45 mins in bexleyheath branch and they want to charge 5 pound for it. ok i paid for it but they didnt get my name on only my wife's name, i came for it today again, explain what happened, and now i have been wait for more.than half an hour and still waiting for. never seen a bank like this this and never experienced like this, so disappointed            
                Please put the online banking back to how it was.there is no balance or minus when you have made a payment.sort it please or I'm moving banks.grrrrr            
                Absolutely terrible company, they have no idea how process a simple request. Upon ringing to complain, and explains my problem, I'm told to wait for 15-20 while they load up the complaint tool........ Such shocking customer service and it really seemed like they knew it and didn't care. Been with this bank since I was 16, and always tried to overlook they're lacking in ability to deal with simple requests, will 100% be changing banks.            
                They dont know what they are doing, avoid this company like the plague. You will spend half your life on hold, they will mess up your application assure you you need lfe insurance etc. Any difficult questions you can assure will be sent to their indian call center where they wont be able to help. waste of time and money.... awfull please heed my advise.            
                I am an accountant used to dealing with banks. However, I have never come across anything as bad as Barclay's.  Went into Eastbourne branch, one teller, loads of too important staff walking around doing nothing. Waited half an hour didn't get served so left whilst too important staff did f*** all. Totally disgusting. Will be moving my account asap            
                Like others I would not even give one star if the option was available - banked with them for 9 years and they do nothing for you at all - this  month salary did not go into account as it has reliably done for all of these years... a Friday, little time to investigate why... horrible text received telling me to rectify it by 3pm... visited branch...no assistance whatsoever - no privacy, no empathy, rude, dismissive and advised if I wanted to discuss in private I 'should have made an appointment' - hilarious, I didnt know it was going to happen did I????The branch advisor was more concerned with her very long acrylic nails (cleaning them) than listening to or advising me.I will be closing account ASAP - wouldnt think Barclays will give a jot!            
                I want to give rating in minus but unfortunately that option doesn't available, it's one of the rubbish bank I have ever experienced in my life service is utterly pathetic and staffs and so rude. First teach them manners and improve your service to get atleast a star.            
                i have to call for the third time to request for my pin, and the customer service personnel asked me questions which i  provided aside my 16 digit numbers because of security reasons.i preferred typing it on my phone.i was surprise to hear from matteo that their system does not allow numbers to be typed, you always have to mention it.meaning customers security concerns are not of importance.i requested to speak to his manager which took me 10 mins on hold, and i presume the lady i spoke to was a colleague not a manager.This lady you can tell was already angry on the phone with me after listening to her colleague.she confirmed the same company's procedures that they cant help without the 16 digit numbers and the system doesn't allow it to be typed.so i raised a concern that, due to customers security issues, their system needs an upgrade to help customers type in their information than to mention it.she said boldly it cant be done.i then said if they cant help,i want to know why i haven't received my pin to date.this lady asked me to contact Royal mail since they have sent it. it is my responsibility  to contact Royal mail for my pin.i asked her twice because i knew this was a wrong information.firstly i haven't received a note from royal mail to contact them for not meeting me or anything.And she was able to tell me they have done their part by sending it.so i have to contact royal mail.seriously i have never heard this anywhere if not Barclays. very very very poor customer service ever.i am thinking of switching already.            
                I Would rather stash my money under my bed than bank with barclays. Horrible service. Take my advice and don't bother with them.            
                Opened a bank account less than a month ago. First debit card never came in the mail. Called customer service and was instructed to go in-branch to print a new debit card. I go in branch and they tell me they can't do that since my account is less than a month old (did the person on the phone not know that?). They cancel my first debit card and send a second one through the mail. They say it's gonna take 5 working days but I'm still waiting for this debit card as well. Horrible bank.            
                I just signed up with Barclays and I've only had negative experience with them so far. Their Indian call centre is pathetic and unprofessional! They are rude, unhelpful and just don't underhand customers frustration. I had a credit card with them and closed it immediately based on my initial experience with them.  I've filed a complaint and still receive the worst banking experience. This is coming from someone who has banked with Halifax Santander HSBC. I will never Bank with Barclays again!! Not worth my time or money. Go somewhere else! Don't waste your time            
                New app not as good as old. Difficult to navigate, the information is not as clear. No running balance with statement. No actual balance and available one so not certain if funds have cleared. Very clunky . Bring back the old version.            
                booked appointment on phone regarding personal loan,visited branch and met advisor, wasnt in the chair 5 minutes before being told no chance dispite having a regular income of 10k a year , recovering cancer patient getting pip payment ,wasted journey could and should have been avoided if telephone call had explained to me ,they had all the info they needed to assess me ,i feel they are prejudice towards people in same situation as me despite being told that as long as i had regular income i would be treated as anyone else            
                I took a business loan from Barclays, but they lied about the terms of it. Now they've ruined my business and are setting about ruining me financially.Stay well away.            
                worst bank experience ever in my whole life. today my card got deactivated by barclays because they sent me a new one which I didn't receive because had been sent out TODAY too. i mean, seriously?  how on earth am i supposed to get my new card today if u sent it today, and how dare they to block my card the same day my new one ha been sent? tomorrow i am flying abroad for my holidays, and someone through the customer service said that they might be able to help me at any branch tomorrow morning.. well they better, and what if my flight was tonight? i think it's time to change bank.            
                Barclays online banking helping center with email or telephone are playing ball games, they tell you to contact by the other way, but never can sort out any problem. Plus their account manager are the most useless roles, they can not answer any directly question and help their business customer with any single issue, they keep referring us back to call the customer help line! The account manager we had is ''Vanessa Lee'' if this is a genuine person, not their Indian call center using made up names! This bank is a joke!            
                The worst telephone banking customer service I have ever suffered.  It took over 30 minutes to speak to someone with enough command of English to send me a password reset for my mortgage account. I opened the account years ago  with ING who were outstanding. Barclay's what have you done?NG            
                The Indian call centre tries to help, but are completely useless. Some of the conversations are even comical because they are so clueless.            
                If I could have scored a minus figure I would. Call centre staff on their 0330 helpline do not know what they are doing, online system unusable, waiting time to speak to helpline unacceptable, international payments, that went through ok on BIB, will not go through on .Net. All in all, terrible            
                I am amused by my interactions with Barclays. We only have a mortgage with them as it was taken out with Woolwich so now falls under Barclays (sadly). We are HSBC Premier, Amex Platinum etc customers. My two interactions with Barclays to simply get access to an online mortgage account have encouraged me to believe I will never take any products with this company. - Indian call centre has no idea what they are doing - "may I place you on hold while I look into that sir?" Read - I have no idea how to do that so am asking someone or looking it up in the manual!- I will now transfer you to someone in mortgage services" - read someone who speaks and understands English and should be better trained so can answer your question (Liverpool call centre)- on one of the two occasions the genius in India transferred me to new mortgage applications - thanks for that. The person in new mortgages (Liverpool) then said he would put me straight through to the right person for my question - oops, somehow back in the hold system for 10 minutes. Sorry Mr. Customer, we don't really give a rat's a**e about you so I just lied.All this to get online access to mortgage details. 1st call over 45 minutes, second call 29 minutes (to get membership number and find out how much new remortgaged payment would be). 2nd call only baca use passcode was sent in post but not membership number...thanks for making me wait for it only to find it never arrived.I wonder if anyone from Barclays reads these...you would probably want our business. If you can't even run mortgage customer service efficiently then I am not trusting investments and other financial products with you. Appalling performance.            
                Basically tried to open a bank account for my sister today and this guy working there comes checking out my passport asking where im from as if that has anything to do with the credit check. Told him im from Greece showed him my sister's passport and her National insurance number that they asked me as a proof of adress. My sister had our previous adress on her NIN letter which makes sense since you get your NIN issued once and not every month. This guy tells us to go to the job center sort out the adress and come back in two weeks time when he would be ready for another appointment and once we tried asking wether the previous adress is a problem he told us im not going to have this conversation again, get out bye. Rudeness at its finest. Went to find one of the customer service women working there in the afternoon and once i start talking to her about it she seemed familiar with the topic as if they had gossiped around it on lunch break and she told me hasnt our employee told you what the problem is? i said yes. And then she said then i see no reason why i should keep talking to you and just left. How do these people even get a job there in the first place.            
                I have had only good experiences with Barclays? Their online banking is excellent.            
                Opening an account at Barclays is an absolute nightmare. First of all, the branch in Bradford is absolutely swamped with customers and won't take appointments, so it takes forever to even start the process. Then they send you about eight different envelopes and emails, all with different numbers, and it's very unclear what you should use to log onto online banking.I've been trying to set up an account for almost two weeks now, and one would think that a bank would be eager for me to put money into it. If you're coming from overseas, I would recommend checking out some other banks first.Only plus side of my whole experience is that the actual employees I've talked to have been lovely. They have tried to help, it just seems like they're operating within a terrible system.            
                Barclays have removed this , and brought out a new one which is similar to the iPhone version, it's supposed to be better but it actually didn't have as many functions. For example I like a ' running balance ' to be shown after each transaction . Being on a budget like most people , this allows you to see 'how you are' on income and expenditure at the same point last month or the month before. The new app for iPad dosnt have this , unlike the previous one, which I was prompted by Barclays into deleting. It's as if they font want you monitor spending efficiently . Be careful before you delete the old version as it seems you can't bring it back            
                I am trying to close my (old Ing) savings account, purchased by Barclays. I completed the account closure form & sent it to the appropriate department. Today I receive a letter saying you need a copy of my signature & I am to go into a Barclays bank to do this. Just got back, having wasted my time. The list of ID is so prescriptive I cannot provide the identification required. The Ing account was in my maiden name (like many professional women I use my maiden name). My passports are in my married name; I am 69 years old so my driving licence is a pink one and is also in my married name and I have never had a Barclays account. The counter assistant would not accept my birth certificate nor my debit card - as it wasn't Barclays!  Whoever devised this ID list is an idiot, male & I suspect very young!  This is a problem of your making so please let me know how you are going to solve the problem without wasting any more of my time. Of course you insist that the only card  ID I have from Barclays is returned with the closure form. Genius!It gets better! I emailed a complaint to Barclays & got a reply telling me to phone them as they need more information. Of course they have my telephone ID card (which they say should be returned with the account closure form) so I cannot identify myself if I do phone them! I then try to email them, but as soon as I confirm it is concerning an existing complaint I am required to identify myself using the card I had to send to them with the account closure form. They do try to phone me on one occasion but I could not take the call. They asked When I was free to take a call & I responded but I have heard nothing since. What kind of Mickey Mouse organisation is this bank? I can't wait to contact the Ombudsman, although I suspect I shall be in a long queue!!            
                The member of staff at Barclays Bishops Stortford branch met me and proceeded to tell me about her itchy tights. When we were seated her tone became confrontational and authoritarian. She barked, "what's your overdraft limit'. I said I never need to use it so I couldn't answer the question." She then told me that as it was my account I should know everything about it and if I couldn't answer the questions she wouldn't be able to help me". If I hadn't complained I do not think she would have made the extra effort to ask me another more reasonable and answerable question which enabled the verification process to proceed.Having been a Barclays customer for  many years I have been shocked to realise that their standard of customer service has fallen to such a low level. They clearly do not rate customer relations enough to train their staff in how to speak to customers. I will be banking elsewhere in future.            
                I have been trying to clear a Santander credit card  bill from money in my Barclays account for over a month without success.I first tried to do this at a Barclays branch in Bexleyheath which was refurbished to have no cashiers,only machines when it re-opened.Despite several attempts to pay the bill I was constantly told that the payment was over the limit.It was coming from my own account at Barclays from my own money to pay my own bill but it would not let me.As it seems impossible to get cheques from the bank I could not pay with a cheque and bank giro credit either,plus there were no cashiers to give the payment to even if I somehow had an old cheque to use.I had to go to the foreign till(this had a person) and after  many minutes trying to convince them I was not trying to defraud myself they agreed to process the bill.Alas they put in a 4 instead of a 5 as the first number unknown to me and the bill was returned unpaid and even more interest accumulated.Since then I have tried to make the payment by phone a number of times and after going through the long identification process every time am told "the system will not allow the payment".Now it seems these call centres are not  UK based and it proved impossible to explain that I was not trying to defraud myself by paying my own bill with my own money.It was obvious it was me as I answerednumerous questions and was prepared to answer any others they could think of.All they did was to keep me holding on for ages to ask a supervisor only to get the same answer..After being badgered to have on-line or mobile banking which I have refused every time,numerous times they finally agreed to take the payment,but unbelievably only if I used the details they had input wrongly previously.Perhaps they thought I would be pleased at having another payment bounced  because of the wrong details.I explained that all they needed to do was substitute a 5 for the 4 they had incorrectly input,but surprise,surprise they said the system would not allow it.I had even waited patiently for two weeks for a "passcode" to arrive and they could not even send that to me,conveniently blaming the post.I have never had a problem previously with the post especially the junk mail from Virgin Media,Sky,BT and numerous insurance companies..I was even asked what I wanted to do to resolve my complaint and I said "just pay this bill"but was again told the system would not allow it.Therefore they cannot or will not resolve my complaint.,I was asked if there was anything else they could HELP me with..I wonder exactly what Barclays definition of help could be.            
                I really am surprised how an incompetent company can still function!  They messed up my account three times in a row and placed false information on my credit history.Clearly they don't want any customers!            
                I am meant to be running a business not sitting waiting for a poorly ruin business to ruin mine.Every time I call business banking I wait 20 minutes plus.Why can't I score zero stars.            
                The worst customer service I have encountered in my whole life. I will absolutely be changing banks as soon as I can. So disappointing.            
                I have had so many problems with this bank. Spontaneous pin sentry blocking while abroad and unable to unblock it without a new card being sent. Card being sent but no the pin when specifically ask for. Being asked to find a Barclays cash machine abroad otherwise they cannot unblock my pin. Unable to change my bank home address to one abroad without going to the bank. Unable to help me when fraud was on my account because i didn't know one of the three security questions and they didnt have an alternative question.. The suggestion again go to Barclays bank in person. Well they are closing all the banks now and who will pay for the flight and time home when im abroad!!!!!!!! URGGHHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHH!!!!!!!            
                They keep refusing my card payment from time to time ok if its at some dodgy merchants buy paypal (I use it regulary for 10years)            
                I walked in to make a payment for my elderly neighbour today at the chorlton branch. There was only two cashiers on the desks although the desk had many more spots that could have been used by staff members. The queue of coustomers was nearly out the door. I waited a while whist others were complaining and getting the same answer we are understaffed today. Well I thought why not use the drop off service but ofcorse there was nobody to help me use this service as I've never used it before. I was paying in a fair amount of money so I didn't want to chance it even though a kind member of the public offers to help me. I suggested to your staff maybe they should employ her. I was late for work waiting in a queue I couldn't see moving. This seems to happen every time I go in this branch. Hire more staff because this can't continue. Nobody even apologised. I'm not happy and will be spreading the word about that horrible cold unwelcoming stuffy branch that is chorlton. Maybe I will try again tomorrow when I have an hour to spare.            
                Making a bank transfer through Barclays online is almost a miracle.My pinsentry card reader was broken, so I phoned Barclays Customer service on the first of August 2016 I was advised my Pinsentry card reader was ordered for me and I should received it in ten working days, after 15 days as I did not receive it, I phoned them again and no answer was given. After asking for other options to make the bank transfer, I was advised that It could be made on the phone.On the phone, I was asked more than 15 questions, after 50 minutes on the phone (50 euros bill) and answering all of them, I was advised that the bank transfer could not be made, "please call again tomorrow", call again tomorrow for what? To suffer the same type of interrogatory? It is 29th of August (one month gone) and I haven't received the pinsentry card reader, the bank transfer has not been made and the money is blocked fue to these type of incompetent "workers"I don't desire this to my worst enemy, Faithfully            
                I have never in my life been treated so badly by customer service assistant. I have been customer of barclays for over 10 years and their customer service went down hill. All i wanted was to report/cancel my lost card and order a new card to be sent to my address on the record. The customer service assistant was rude, didn't let me talk, was interrupting constantly. I came off the phone shaking and crying.            
                I tried to contact support on their website because I was having some issues with one of my credit cards. It took ages to receive a feedback and they asked to call them. I did that and my problem was solved but I would recommend them to improve their online customer support.            
                The branches customer service is the worst in history you can stay on a queue for five hours just to get more cash that you can't get from the machine. The bank is a joke of the century. Staff are very sluggish and careless about customers, they are the whole epitome of frustrated workforce            
                After trying to withdraw money from my bank account and it being declined, i was sent a text message asking me to respond with 'Y' if it was me, or 'N' if it wasn't. After replying i was able to withdraw the cash only a minute afterwards! Excellent!   Later on that evening i tried to purchase a years car insurance and my card wasn't being accepted online - i called right away via the App thinking my card had been blocked because of what had happened at lunchtime. I spoke to two amazing people at customer service - a lovely lady, Amy and another man - shame I don't remember his name! They got my card sorted out, put my mind completely at rest and the cherry on the cake was that i was only on the phone for 10 minutes - no hassle, no repeating myself. If only all customer service was as helpful!            
                After an excellent account opening and fast turnaround that is where any reasonable service from barclays business banking stops, we have had so many issues with this bank that to list every one would fill the page,1. Constantly blocking either our card & account when trying to pay our telephony provider (this is a £5 transaction, yet no problem with paying Barclaycard over £100 a month)2. Allowing cancelled DirectDebits to come out of the account then having the cheek to try and charge us for it.3. The majority of telephone banking staff cannot speak or understand proper english, we have tried three times to have an incorrect payment returned only for the wrong one to be returned leading to more accounting headache for us.The above is a shame because the service from our local branch staff was excellent, but the telephone banking team is abysmal. Now swtiching to another bank as the hassle of sorting this out every week is not worth the free banking period.            
                I discovered that my card had been used fraudulently to purchase a mountain bike online.  My account was overdrawn as a result.  The attitude of the people at the call centre was appalling - they just spouted gobbledegook from a crib sheet and I might as well have been speaking to a machine. They said I "might" get my money back.  I asked them to contact the bike company to advise them that they should not dispatch the goods but they refused - so I had to. The bike company were very on the ball and had spotted that it was dodgy and did not process the order.  My money is, therefore, "in limbo" - as Barclays put it - to be returned to my account at their convenience. Maybe. I complained about my treatment but all they kept saying was that my complaint had been marked as resolved as it was an internal matter and feedback had been given.  I kept saying that, as far as I was concerned, my complaint was not resolved and I wanted to discuss it with someone. Awful, just awful.  Clearly all the people who work there have been given humanity bypasses. I can't afford to lose this money.  I told the chap on the phone that I had had cancer and was having difficulty working, therefore money was tight which was greeted with total silence. Essentially Barclays have stolen my money.            
                My first written instruction on my business account was 1/10/2015. Totally ignored. Chased, chased again & again. Still nothing. Spent hours on the phone doing 'international musical chairs' between various call centres. Promised faithfully problems sorted..... to no avail. And so it continues...... all the way to August 2016 for an account switch to another bank and..... they can't even do that ! The reasons ? Barclays hold our business name in 3 separate forms (including the correct one they use for correspondence. The other truncated forms have been created by them and prevent the switch. More complaints, phone calls & letters. Not ONE helpful response that has resolved a SINGLE THING. Draw your own conclusions. It's real and a farce of a bank.            
                Absolutely appalling and incompetent level of service.We wanted to port our mortgage across to a new property this year.Firstly, we informed our mortgage advisor of the details of our purchase and of our solicitors details in January of this year, he then promptly passed the details to The Woolwich.Two weeks later, we were informed that our solicitor was not acceptable as they did not appear on The Woolwich approved panel of solicitors, despite this particular solicitor having a current working relationship with The Woolwich, this was confirmed during a phone call to the solicitor.We then faced two weeks of lost time plus the embarrassment of having to explain to our solicitor that we would no longer be pursuing our case with them, fortunately they were very understanding and were also at a loss to understand the actions of The Woolwich.We then found another solicitor, which ultimately would lead to further delays as our original solicitor was dealing with both the sale of our old property and the purchase of our new property.My wife was also asked at this time to provide original copies of her most recent bank statements and wage slips, despite already having provided these.Our youngest daughter was also asked to complete a form a concerning the mortgage conditions as she is over eighteen years of age, despite having signed and returned the same form a few weeks previously.We then waited until the 25th April before we could complete on our new property.Our solicitor wrote to The Woolwich to clarify a couple of points concerning the mortgage conditions and waited four and a half weeks for an answer having written three letters over a period of four weeks.During this period, The Woolwich also received phone calls from us on this matter, only to be met with obscure and meaningless excuses.They also received a number of calls and emails from our mortgage adviser, to no avail.The only response to these requests was to send out a mortgage offer each time instead of answering our solicitor’s query in order to progress.We now have a collection of four identical mortgage offers, the first of which had my wife’s name spelt incorrectly.When the mortgage transferred to our new property, we did not receive a refund of our early repayment charge after the first payment to the new account despite being told that this would be automatically refunded five to ten working days later.Again, this involved many phone calls from both us and our mortgage adviser, with no results.They even asked us for the account number relating to the refund when they had these details in front of them!! We eventually received the refund over a month later.I cannot believe the amateurish and incompetent excuses we were given when trying to communicate problems to them.Both my wife and I ended up on anti depressants due to the stress created, I am still considering taking legal action against them and have The Woolwich named on my medical records as a direct cause of stress.My wife and I have vowed to never involve ourselves with The Woolwich again, when our five year fixed period expires on our mortgage, we will be looking for a more competent mortgage provider.            
                somewhere in India - they just don't understand.....            
                Very good customer service.  Helped me set up an account quickly and listened to my needs.            
                Barclays Walsall are very bad treat you like dirt un help full lost my money or they stole it. there counter staff are very rude the women and the branch manager is even worse its our money not your she said excuse me it is my hard earned money i want it back thieves            
                If you want to run a business don't have a business account with Barclays. As soon as you buy something from overseas they will block your debit card. They won't tell you it's blocked until you buy something and get declined. You then have to jump through more hoops than a acrobat only for them to tell you that you have to go into branch with 2 forms of ID. What they don't tell you is that one of those HAS to be a passport. I don't have a passport so it took me kicking off in branch to get them to accept my driving licence to shut me up in front of other customers. Then despite me paying monthly for the privilege to hold this account the fraud team tell me that they are doing ME a favour accepting a government produced piece of ID!! WOW!! Don't think a complaint will get anywhere either, I'm still awaiting for a reply from over 2 months ago. They credited my account with £10 to try and shut me up!I've had my debit card blocked every time I make an overseas business purchases. Despite reassurances I never receive a call or email. It's impossible to run a business with Barclays unless you only do business within the UK.            
                Went in to open account on 6th july had a exellence service i did no problems what so every so far.            
                The people at Barclays are rude the staff are rude to me when I went to branch so I told them that I want an appointment they said we have 1 appointment available in 2 months! I said f*** that to them walked straight out and walked in to Halifax next door and they said they could see me straight away! I had a Current Account with them within 5 mins of walking out of Barclays and they were really nice!!! Don't go to Barclays switch to Halifax best Customer Services on phone and live chat!! Well done Halifax Accrington 11-00-08 Definantly recommend Halifax Bank            
                I have been with this bank since I opened an account at 16, I have been reliable and never asked anything of the bank other than to keep my money safe. I have just bought my first house no thanks to Barclays. I was rejected from my first choice of mortgage and the member of staff dealing with my application advised me to go to my own bank, Barclays, as I'd probably get a mortgage with them a lot easier since I've been with them for so long. However, Barclays refused to even offer me an appointment and straight out told me the following word by word; "You're wasting your time. If one bank rejects you the rest of them will". This treatment was appalling, weeks later I have bought a house and have the keys no problem. Barclays have lost business not giving me a chance or even assessing my eligibility themselves and will lose a customer soon enough as I will be transferring all my accounts to any other bank.            
                I do not often have to complain about Barclay's service as it is usually very good but I am afraid once again they have left me totally in the lurch.I should say first of all that my account is several thousand pounds in credit.A few weeks ago I was sent a new Barclays Card. This was a bit of a surprise as my current one does not expire until Feb 2019 but I thought it might be quite useful having two.As I was just about to set off for a trip around Europe, I thought no more about it and it seemed wisest to leave the other one safely at home.In the last day or so, I found I was unable to use my card. It was unclear whether this was to do with the Banking System in Italy, which is where I am now or whether my card had been blocked for some reason. I had not received any emailed or texted notifications so phoned in to check.It seems that:-1) Yes, the card has now been stopped2) The person answering my call was unable to do anything about it.3) I will have either to ask a relative to post my new card to me, or somehow manage on the generosity of others until I return to the UK.4) That basically I am left on holiday without funds.I think this is very bad indeed.It seems Barclays think it perfectly ok to cancel a card being used in Italy only two days ago, without making any attempt to query me or warn me and are now unwilling to temporarily unblock it.I must ask the questions:If my card was potentially compromised, why was it ok to leave it working for 4 weeks?Since it was being used during that period in Portugal, France and Italy why was I sent no further warnings that this was likely to happen?Why is there apparently no emergency procedure to look after my needs in the short term?            
                After using a cash point to draw out over £100, the cash point froze, then after 5 mins returned my card, no cash.  After checking online, the money had ben removed from my account...grrr!  I couldn't think of anything worse than trying to contact Barclays thinking of the endless menus to get in touch.However, through online banking located a button to just press 'call' and straight through to an actual human!  Sorted in under 2 mins.Like banking should be!! Well done Barclays - the little things really count!            
                They booked appointment for me at a different branch without telling me, thus wasting my time. When I have asked about this this they were non-apologetic, arrogant and did not even try to help. Incompetent, arrogant staff, especially the Manager on duty on 20/07/2016. I am disgusted with how I was treated by the arrogant manager. He dared to raise his voice with me. Avoid!!!            
                Anyone applying for a Student Overdraft with your Student Additions account? I hope you have a better experience than this:Currently a PhD student, my account with Barclays dates back to my undergraduate studies. I only recently discovered that I can actually have an overdraft - £2,000, not my £10 overdraft I had during my undergraduate studies. (As a non-British student some other banks refused me when I wanted to open an account in 2012, and I eventually did it with Barclays as it had the easiest procedures for someone in my situation - for that, the review won't be 1*).But fast forward to today, 19 July 2016. On my online banking, it is written clearly that I have to go IN BRANCH to apply for my overdraft. 1.20 pm. I show up in one of the Cambridge branches. A young lady asks me how can she help. Everything good so far. I say it's about the student overdraft, and she tells me this is done by video banking nowadays. She adds, " please take a seat and wait" (there was only 1 video banking machine and was busy at that moment). I wait, I wait, I wait, I waaaaait. 1.40pm, I ask another lady the same question just to be sure I am waiting with a purpose. I almost go through reading one academic article on my laptop. Almost 2pm, what is going on? I understood later why it takes so long...2ish pm. A man informs me I can go into the video banking room. He tells me the connection will follow "shortly" and to "just take a seat and wait". I am mildly annoyed, but not angry yet. The screen in front of me shows one 3 minute long Barclays advert. Then another one. Then ANOTHER ONE. "Thank you for waiting. All our advisors are currently unavailable" or something like that shows up on the screen after each advert. I say, great, time for reading again. As I am doing some reading on my laptop screen again, the adverts go on, and go on, I must have seen AT LEAST 5 times an advert portraying a little boy learning how to code and at least another 5 times an advert about how convenient online banking is. ONLY IF I COULD APPLY FOR OVERDRAFT FROM HOME...But bear with me, we get there soon. 2.28pm (I remember the time because I was checking it and was increasingly more outraged about the quality of service). A nice lady appears on the screen, asks me what I need to do, I tell her, and she replies in the same nice way "You cannot do this on video banking, you have to speak to a banker in branch. Sorry about that" BUT THE PEOPLE IN BRANCH TOLD ME I SHOULD TALK TO YOU! "Oh really?" YES "May I talk to one of them?". I ask one of the 5 people walking around the branch with nothing much to do to come talk to her. "We are not doing student overdraft applications on video banking", the lady tells the person from the branch. 2.40ish. I ask the guy, WHAT NOW? After I waited more than one hour to have a conversation and solve nothing?! He says "I will put you on the waiting list for a personal banker" WAITING LIST?! Yes. Do you know how long it will be? I ask, still being a nice and polite person. "30 to 45 minutes". YOU WHAT MATE? 45 minutes?! After waiting over an hour for such a simple, standard procedure, like a student overdraft?! Yes, he said. "Sorry about that." + smile. British politeness at its best. Not the guy's fault, of course, he was probably an intern or just starting a graduate role. The bank itself lacks organisation in customer service. Alright, I say, can I come back in 30 to 45 minutes then? Not really, he said, if someone else arrives meanwhile they will be given priority because they are waiting in branch. ALRIGHT. I have already been waiting for more than 1 hour, what can it be so bad about another 30 minutes...3.20 (I remember the exact time again, for the same reason stated above). Alexandra? Yes. Banker invites me to...Guess what? "Take a seat, I will be with you in a couple of minutes". What? Another wait after my 2 hour wait? Are you really, really testing my patience? Well, he comes back, takes a look on the computer screen, "You can only apply for the £700 overdraft here in branch, but you can apply for the £2000 online". I already checked online, I say, politely, and it is clearly written to apply in branch. "Do you have mobile banking?" Yes, I do. He takes a look at my account on my phone, "I am afraid you have to apply on a desktop computer, the mobile app does not seem to have the option added". ARRGHHH. WHY, just why??? Okay, I say, I am almost missing an appointment now, I will do this at home. 3.28. Left Barclays brach after 2h08min and nothing solved.Back home, I check, following the instructions given in branch, which were a bit different from what option I previously tried. Guess what? Yes, you are right. "Please visit your local branch". No, I do not have the patience to visit again. "I will try the online chat", I tell myself. Genius. Oh wait, I tried that before for other purposes, and, as many reviewers here are saying, that is even worse than the waiting time in branch. But let's finish with the bright side, at least Barclays branch has free wi-fi and I finished quite a lot of work while waiting there. Oh, and it was cool as well, better than the 32 degrees C outside today.            
                Having used Barclays internet banking (BIB) for several years for business banking we are now being compelled to use their new system "Barclays.net" and access to the BIB system is being withdrawn in a few days whether we like it or not. Barclays.net is seriously deficient in facilities for business users and having spent many hours on the phone to their support desk it is clear that their staff are equally unable to explain how to perform some of the simplest but business critical daily functions.Like some of the other contributors to this review we are also now looking for a new bank.            
                Bank as back is OK. People at my branch are quite helpful too but.....online or phone costumer service is....lack of words - is that bad!!!!Example. I used Barclays online live chat the other day - asked if I can have another credit card with them (explained everything in detail) and....person on other end kept me waiting (saying he's looking for an answer) and then.....he said I can and....guess what?! I can NOT. I've applaied for one and they turned me away straight away. Very poor experience especially when everything is going online now and there is such a competition out there too....If I could I would NOT give even one star!!!! And I'm considering moving my accounts somewhere else because there is that much you can take            
                Barclays can be an OK bank, providing normal services in a normal way.  However, I am a premier client with them, and I just spent *35 minutes* o the phone with them, just trying to change a simple direct debit.  They said they were waiting for confirmation from their Fraud Department, and that they could not ring me back or allow me to ring them back to finish the transaction.  Really terrible service today!            
                Been a Barclays customer for 20 years. Today, I applied to Santander. The reason? We cannot spend our own money due to fraud protection. I'm on hold now, greater than 10 mins wait just to access my own money. 2 months ago I did actually discover fraud on my business account. Someone had been ordering paintings and clothes on my business account. Guess what? Barclays didn't even pick it up. Useless bank. Useless customer care.            
                Made a complaint about bank charges on my basic current account for the period of 2010-2014 when I was in severe financial hardship where the charges simply compounded the situation.Within 25 minutes i received a call from a lady (didnt give her name) stating that I would not be due any redress due to the high court ruling of 2009 and that charges were fair and I could call their financial assistance helpline and go to the financial ombudsman if I so wished as this was their final response. I tried to advise her that what she is saying has nothing to do with my complaint, I had complained about financial hardship not fairness. I didnt need the financial helpline now as it was a period for 2 years ago. I asked if she would reassess my complaint as i do not think it was addressed correctly to which she said no. I was frustrated and asked if she could advise what investigations took place since how could a final response be reached within 25 minutes of my complaint being raised when you are looking at 48 months of account but she would not tell me. I asked again if she would reassess my complaint, she said no, that i could go to the ombudsman and that she was going to end the call- total call time less than 6 minutes. I raised a further complaint about how this was handled and my treatment- She would not listen, was abrupt, had not investigated my complaint properly or answer my questions. To this, I had a call back from Barclays from a different gentleman. He was pleasant enough to deal with but was basically defending her actions. He still could not grasp that what she had advised me had nothing to do with the premise of my complaint. Really let down that I made two complaints and neither were investigated properly nor my questions given any consideration. First staff member was pious and abrupt. I would not mind the outcome of any complaint as long as I feel it was dealt with fairly and given due consideration. This was merely cleared as quickly as possible. Not a happy bunny, will be going to the ombudsman (which will cost them more than my entire claim) and closing my account.            
                I recently moved to the UK and had the misfortune of opening a Barclays Account.After receiving my first months wages from work I needed to pay rent.What a circus ...Log onto the online bankingcan't add a new payee ... need to get the app on my phone (apparently this helps prevent fraud)download the app to my phone,register it to me email, (apparently this helps prevent fraud)put an sms code in to prove I have a phone (not necessarily the same phone but apparently this helps prevent fraud)App still doesn't work!Now i have to visit a cash machine, put my card in, put a code from the app into the cash machine, now the cash machine gives me a different code I have to put back into the appNow the app finally works. Hooray!!!I log back onto the online banking, go to add the new payee... you can't add a new payee because that feature is locked out for the first 10 days ... (apparently this helps prevent fraud)So I call the phone banking ... another pin code to log inI get connected to a call centre somewhere in Asia (I feel so secure about my money right now) then Old Mate on the other end of the phone miss-spells the name of the Payee, so the transfer bounces anyway.F#### you very much Barclays!The next time I visit will be to close my account.            
                Held on phone for over 40 minutes and still not answered1. Rubbish Company deserve - minus 100*  Scandalous! In fact they deserve to not be in business.  Just trying to report a fraud.            
                I have a business & personal account with Barclays and use internet banking 99% of the time.Recently used the business call centre to enquire about an overdraft, OH MY GOD!!!!!!!.It took 35 minutes on hold before I finally spoke to someone. I went through a 40 minute questionnaire about my business etc. All looked good until they did a credit search and said I was bankrupt. In reality I have a perfect credit rating, have various other finance agreements  but they just cut me short and said I would be sent a decline letter.Concerned I phoned the 3 main UK credit agencies and was told that there is no bankruptcy showing on my reports and more interestingly Barclays had not even carried out a soft credit search on me or my company.I called Barclays the next day to explain, and had what I can only describe as the most frustrating phone call I have ever had in my entire life.In the end they told me I was a bankrupt and there was nothing they could do about it. Totally dissatisfied with this answer I made an appointment with the Chelmsford branch via another call centre.1 Hour before the meeting, having taken the morning off work, I was called by the branch and told by a chap that he had me booked in his diary but couldn't see me as he was not a business manager and he was double booked anyway.Anyway,I made good use of my morning off to go into another bank and cannot wait to get away from this bunch of unhelpful, unprofessional pathetic excuse of a Bank.            
                Tried to change my business bank account statement correspondence address twice as I forgot my PIN no. Went to the branch at St Albans- twice. The 1st time at the bank, a few months ago- I am told to guess and punch PIN no three times. Then told me it's locked out. I am to go home and online and get it unlock. Wham bam thank you mam. All my fault. That's it.. Who cares?  !!   2nd time- yesterday. Older staff was polite and tried to help. Told me that the business staff can help to change my address on their computer. I had my debit card and bank statements etc. I went upstairs as advised and a 'large' staff said (abruptly) it cannot be done. I am to go home and online to sort it out myself.Then the younger cashier told me to go back upstairs. The younger staff I met were quite blase and sounded abrupt (from the front door to the counter staff). Where do they get their staff from? Where is the customer service training? If I was sick and they are the only medics available, I wouldn't see them.. Can they or can't they help? Will they? Certainly not !!! Wasted my time and journey as usual. I rang Barclays Online helpline and I was passed around a few people. Security checked at least 4 or 5 times by repeating myself Finally after about an hour :(( , I managed to change my address... That was the last straw. I have made appointment to move my account to another bank within the next week. Surely any bank is better than Barclay?I have closed my account at Barclays and moved my account now!!I have moved my business account to HSBC. Go there, go anywhere instead.. I was treated with more courtesy and staff was very helpful. So was the telephone helpline. I am happy bunny now            
                I opened a new account with Barclays Online......Received my debit card, letters etc and just 3 days later got a text message, DEBIT CARD is deactivated due to fraudulent .......... call o8oo.So I did listened to the rubbish she came out with and then explained only had the account for 3 days so no money in or out??????What fraud have I committed, No apology and no reply.....I am glad It happened before I actually transferred anything to this bank. Not to be trusted.... I checked my credit file there was no issue??? BARCLAYS AT LEAST TELL THE TRUTH..            
                Barclays are now expecting everyone to do their own banking at branch using the machines.I pay bank charges and as a business customer paying in cash and cheques this is totally unacceptable.....will be changing banks.            
                We have been with Barclays 9 years, in that time we have had one mess after another.  Firstly they refused to change my name on the account after my deed poll.  Stating that the deed poll was not official, despite the same one being ised to change both my passport and driving license.  Then they changed it after a 16 week wait to see our business manager, then two days later it reverted back.  We have had unathorised transactions that no one could explain, and now they have suddenly changed the "automatic" decsion on our our account wothout telling us.  The call centre use to be great, but now it's been moved off to some obscure part of the empire where english is barely understood, they are unable to give you any answers and always default to telling you to see your business manager.  They spend a fortune on sponsorship, and ornaments in theor branches but then they can with the anount they charge their customers.  Seriously if you are in business avoid them at all costs, it could quite easily wreck your business.  We have a second account with HSBC and they could not do more for us.            
                thorpe bay barclays is the most poorly managed, awful bank ive ever been to. you often have to wait 50 minutes or more to get served by the only cashier open. the self serve machines do not replace cashier services will the banks ever learn that its not about saving themselves money by putting in these awful machines, the customers dont want them, they are not quicker, keep the cashiers open and reduce the queuing times. awful, awful thorpe bay barclays            
                Been with Barclays eleven years and customer service gets worse steadily by the year. I will be opening a new account with another bank tomorrow as I've had enough now! Most recently, I wasted 45mins on the phone talking to a very incompetent, rude customer service agent who kept me on hold twice and eventually declared her computer is not working and I should call back. No apology, nothing. Just said "you have to call back, I can't do anything". They have a reputation for freezing or suspending accounts for unlimited time without warning for the smallest reason. Families have gone begging since Barclays has frozen both breadwinners accounts suddenly without warning.            
                Went into Swindon regent street branch to open an account for my son today - greeter was hopeless - never asked if I was a premier customer and wasted my time - offered me an appointment to set up an account in 18 days time - what a joke . Looks like customer service is not important - one of the worst banking experiences ever  - offered a times lot that was during the middle of the day on a week day as they don't set up new accounts on weekends !!!!!!! So went to Halifax bank - who set up a new account in 10 mins with no appointment - much better customer service and a pleasure to deal with. Barclays need to improve their customer service massively            
                Like many on here being kept on hold for hours then cut off with no explanation. Customer service representatives who have no idea what they are doing so always asking someone else for help. Had a credit card for £1000 on my business account which was overpaid regularly before the due date. After paying £500 off the £900 balance one month it was reduced straight after payment with no warning. When asked why it seems I did not meet their financial criteria at that time. I am of the same opinion as many others who consider  Barclays devious, untrustworthy and totally unprofessional. I am due to finish a degree so Barclays will not be benefiting  from my new income levels. Trust works both ways.            
                I would stay well clear of barclays as today I has a payment come out of my account that I didn't authorise to come out I then contacted the bank who were very unhelpful in dealing with this and I was told there was nothing they was going to do about this and they put the phone down on me... I then rang them back to talk to a manager who told me the exact same that they wasn't going to do anything about this and if I wanted something doing about it I had to take the matter to court since then I have been on the phone to my bank most of today to try and get this matter resolved after talking to a deferent person every time I was told different information everyone I called and when I told them I will be leaving them and going to a different bank all they said was ok that's fine they are nothing but a waste of space!!!!            
                Definitively Barclays is a very tiresome bank. They decided, on their own, to convert my Current Account Plus into a Barclays Bank Account without asking me. They added since this past 13th May some services I am not interested at all but of course I will have to pay for them!!You want to claim and you have to log in, to confirm your passcode, your ID, and many other steps and when you try to chat none is in the other side.They are closing many branches in the High Streets because they want to bring better customer service!!??. Of course, now you have an online  24/7 service for you to talk to them. Who is thinking of calling a bank on Sunday at 3am or on Wednesday at 10pm or on Thursday at 12am ... It is ridiculous. And also, which kind of banking expertise are able to provide via those services, by phone or chat?. Accenture some months ago posted a report about how much customers miss human interactions and expertise and this bank is removing it at the time than increasing fees with the excuse they want to provide better services. More banks are suffering now from their own blindness, they are unable to move on appropriately in the market. If you want to be online 100% be cheaper.I am exhausted already of trying to find them on the phone, chat or sending an email. I will cancel my personal and business account very soon. They are terrible.            
                Been in UK for a year now. Delayed payments, Non-accurate transaction history, constantly down services. Worst bank I've ever been with. Do yourself a favour & stay away from Barclays.            
                To be honest, we opened a buisness account in worksop, and they have been brilliant. Our buisness manager michelle has been great, always there to help.  We do most of our banking in Retford,  Where we need £10,000 out at times,  they have never let us down. Excellent service, would recomend.....  THE RETFORD CAR COMPANY.            
                I am trying to cash in a bond.  Barclays keep saying I have not filled in the form.  I have-twice, and posted it twice.   Once it might go missing, but two times - I doubt it.  I've tried phoning - phone goes dead.  I've tried emailing - no answer.  The bank will not tell me what is going on or give me my money.  My cash isn't banked at Barclays, it's serving life imprisonment.            
                Barclays are the worst organisation I have ever encountered. After TEN YEARS they STILL send statements to the wrong address, even though every time I ring them I change the addess and someone assures me it’s been updated. They block my card and suspend my account constantly, in the name of fraud protection. It gets to the point that even buying groceries in the supermarket causes them to block my card. Their customer service is deplorable beyond words. My worst experience was when I lost my card while in South America. When I rang them they made me go through byzantine security checks and then told me they couldn’t block my account (for the first time ever...) because I had failed the security check. The man on the phone would not give any more details. When I asked them to send me a new card, he refused. So did his supervisor. When I asked how the hell I was supposed to get home with no money, he told me to “pop into my local branch”. I explained that my nearest branch was 5,000 miles away. He said he could not offer further assistance and hung up. When I finally got home (thanks to a friend and Western Union) I went straight into Barclays to find out what was going on. The “Customer Care” rep was extremely reluctant to let me see my own account on screen, and when I was eventually allowed to look at my own information i was told that the phone moron doing the security checks had been reading the wrong information. The only reason I didn’t close the account was the sheer hassle, but as I have just this minute had my card suspended for trying to buy groceries in the same supermarket I use my card in every week, I am closing my account. Barclays behind-the-scenes personnel are the rudest, most breathtakingly incompetent people I have met, and the organisation as a whole is a total shambles.            
                This manager supposedly says other than the CEO he's the next guvnor!!!the bluudy cheek!!!Have a financial ombudsman complaint multiple ones including fraud that they never addressed...beware            
                Unacceptable behaviour. We went into a branch to sort out some stuff with my fathers account as his English is not excellent so it was a more convenient option. To our disappointment it didn't live to our expectations, even though the people in Bromley branch serving as were nice, Shahinul and Tanya, and tried their best to accommodate our needs, one of our problems had to be sorted over the phone and customer service representative was extremely rude, Mr Kalpam Pachauri, he had screamed at my farther for wasting his time and instead of dealing with the issue we had kept on complaining to us that we didn't understand what he wanted telling us he didn't have time for this. How can someone not have time to do his own job? My poor farther experienced such a shock from this service that his blood pressure increased by far. Further to this we were offered further reviews on our account but the person dealing with us ran out of time and told us he wont be able to accommodate. Even though Shahinul Ali was a very nice man I don't think it was very professional to offer us a service that the bank personnel wasn't able to accommodate. Knowing we have experienced such a horrible service prior to this, it didn't help our overall experience.  A very disappointed customer, and certainly wont be recommending Barclays bank.            
                Worst customer service that exists in any industry.For 3 years I have suffered error after error by Barclay's.They are incompetent beyond words. I am now going to close all accounts even though its a pain.They are expensive and have the worst processes I have ever experienced.How they have any customers is a mystery in line with the Pyramids and Quantum Physics.            
                Terrible service from branch to branch-- not being able to open a credit card in branch nor make an appointment to do so.            
                After 3 years, Barclays closed both my business and personal accounts without a valid explanation. I called to find out if it was a mistake and they said that I no longer met their financial criteria. I asked what criteria I failed on? He said he could not give any more details. I logged a complaint and got a called from  an unknown number.I asked how my credit/fraud ratings would be affected.He said as it is a two month notice there was no effect on either my credit nor fraud rating and it was no different from me closing my account myself!So the only take I had on this was that I was not a profitable Barclays customer! That I can somehow understand.To my utter dismay however, I tried to move funds from my accounts online to my other bank to prepare with the closing down of my account - only to find that it had been blocked - no warning. I called them back and they confirmed it. In fact ALL facilities - debit card, online banking, etc had been withdrawn!I had spoken to two different people on the same day and they never mentioned this. I expected to have at least a month of the two months to sort things out.As a result of this fiasco, I have had to cancel my business travel plans in order to sort this out.The whole thing just does not make moral sense and something really should be done about it.So my advise to any one is to avoid Barclays.            
                Slow, pathetic customer service who are constantly having technical difficulties.Transaction updates are useless, payment come out/show up DAYS later than what they should have, one came out a month late and they blamed the company that took the money out.Catching me off guard a number of times.Good-bye Barclays.            
                My account had been suspended, for some reason the company wouldn't even explain to me. After days of calling up and getting no where, i finally found out it was due to someone i didn't even know putting money in to my account and trying to take it out. And from this i was to suffer, and have no access to my money to pay for food, fuel to get to work. Barclays said my account wont be active for at least another week, so im left with nothing and there is nothing they can do. DONT GO WITH BARCLAYS!            
                Online banking: transactions are updated with horrible 2-3 days delay. Over the weekend they don't update a single transaction and the account balance is horribly inadequate.  After checking her account balance yesterday night, my wife went shopping today afternoon. But guess what? She ended up with refused payment as none of her card weekend transactions were included in her account balance.This is just embarrassing. Just waiting for my paycheck this month and switching to NatWest or LLoyds - the further from Barclays, the better.            
                Hi all, I have been a Barclays customer for 4-5 years now. I heard of Blue Rewards at the begining of 2016 and decided to apply for it from February onwards since I was perfectly eligible:1 - I get paid every month above the requirement of 800 pounds2 - I make at least two debit card transactions every month3 - As part of the Blue rewards I paid 3 pounds out of my account every month.I have been paying this amount since February every on the on the 2nd and was meant to receive 7 pounds every month on the 12th but have not received anything. Since February I have called them 4-5 times and all they tell me is that its a maintenance problem. They sent me to a branch and they also put me on the phone there. Going to the branch was a total waste of time because they still were not able to help me. Its been almost three months now and they haven't resolved the issue yet. I am considering changing banks now because I lost my trust in Barclays.            
                An absolute ballache, for unaccounted for missing money and not being able to track where it had gone whilst I was travelling, to cancelling my card and ordering a new one to my old address without telling me, PRETENDING to order me a new card so I'm without a card or source of payment for direct direct debits and simple money transfers for over a week. Absolute joke, just took myself to Natwest so I can close this account after my next paycheque.            
                Be very careful if shopping online and you wanna open dispute the corruption system won't help you            
                Barclays have an appalling attitude when it come to the safety of your card or the service experience of their customers.After waiting 30 minutes on hold to report my 94yo mother-in-law's lost bank card I hung up and tried again but the same thing.  So I called as if to pay the balance on my card and got through immediately!  Indian call centre of course.  I explained that I actually needed to report a lost card and they transferred my call.  After another 30 minutes I hung up, called as if to pay a bill and insisted to speak to a manager.  He stated he could not help but promised to put my call through and would monitor my call to ensure it got through.  It didn't and after 20 minutes he gave up and just left me to it.  After another 20 minutes I hung up again.This was late at night and my mother in law who had tried to answer questions asked by the to verify her ID was getting exhausted so I hung up and promised my mother in law we would go to a branch the following morning.  She spent all night worrying about her card and it made her quite ill.I find it appalling that Barclays make it impossible to report a lost card over the phone and their call centre staff are next to useless.Just wish I could award 0 stars.  Barclays, you have lost two long standing customers.            
                have decided in their wisdom, to replace all but one cashier with computers, which means when you have to do a transaction where you cant use a machine you can wait for ages. I have waited for 35 minutes, with two people in front of me and 45 minutes with four people in front of me, who has the time for this. Perhaps if they put more cashiers and better service in the branches they wouldn't have to spend so much money on TV advertising. I have closed my account in favour of a bank that provides a decent service.            
                ...I business bank with Barclays (Over £1million a year) + they earn good money out of us but do we get a good service? No chance they could not care less. They treat their business customers just as badly as they treat someone with a small current account balance.You can thank our politicians and the ombudsman for letting the big banks walk all over their customers.            
                Away from home at the moment and lost my handbag with my purse, bank cards and bus/train passes in. Went into a Barclays branch to cancel cards and see if I could get any money as I had no means of getting to where I was staying. Expected to be asked lots of questions but guy kept saying have you got your passport. How many people carry their passport whilst travelling in this country? Eventually he agreed to give me £20 so that I could get a bus to where I was staying. He told me he had cancelled my cards. I told him I had two and he said it would do both of them. Went into another branch today to see if There was any way I could get some cash only to be told one of the cards was still active. Brilliant so much for being a premier customer.            
                Recently had the pleasure of porting an existing mortgage, the whole process from start to finish was a disgrace. From the branch to the contact centre. Different information from anyone I spoke to. They sent my loan papers to the wrong solicitor which is obviously holding things up. When my fixed rate is up i'm off.  I can't believe how bad the service is from a company this size.            
                I recently made two purchases on the Barclays SmartSpend (smart?) scheme. This scheme purports to pay a set percentage of the transaction back to the customer. A further 1% is supposedly added later if you are a Rewards customer (unlikey). However on checking my purchase records 3% of £499 spend states a £12.47 cashback and the second transaction of 2% of £79 states £0.98 cashback. Small short change but multiply that by a few thousand transactions a month and it's quite a significant amount isn't it? Attempting to speak to their ridiculous call centre was over three hours of nonsense. Nobody there understood the SmartSpend concept at all and did all they could to stop a formal complaint being registered. This is a shame because the staff at my local branch would easily have sailed through a 5-star rating. Having a call centre staffed by people who cannot understand the banks own schemes, or English if you try to explain the scheme, is ridiculous. To refuse to lodge a customers complaint is shameful and clearly common practice as three staff refuged to log the complaint.            
                I rang the main Barclays call centre due to not being able to complete an application online for a financial product. I arranged an appointment for two weeks' time at my local branch to finish the application. Was told I would receive a text to confirm and that the personal banker would also call me the day before the appointment. Received neither of these so the afternoon prior, I called again and as the appointment was for the following day they sent a priority e-mail to the named staff member I was due to be seeing asking to call me first thing (on the appointment day). No call received. This tells me all I need to know about the company and will go elsewhere for my finance needs, to a company that actually does what they say they will. The fact that they never respond to criticism on this site speaks volumes.            
                Please leave while you can. Barclays can actually ruin your life. So I am currently away from the UK and my debit card expired. Due to currency fluctuations in the country I am in presently, I decide why don't I just call Barclays customer care change my address to an international one and get my new debit card sent to me so I pay for visa application and my flight. Apparently Barclays changed my address, and then flags my order as a fraud. International calls cost an arm and a leg here lost all my limbs calling Barclays customer care and Fraud. All I am told now is to visit my nearest branch with and ID which I have already presented to open the account. So now I can't apply for a visa and can't pay my flight ticket. In conclusion, Barclays will ruin your life. Close your account if you can, a dog provides better banking services.            
                Normally I am not one to write reviews, however the time I have wasted by simply trying to open a student account is absolutely ridiculous. The first time I went to validate documents I got sent away because the letter from the university did not include "Manchester" after the postcode, which already makes it clear it is in Manchester. When I came back the second time with a corrected letter, first my national ID (from Germany) got inspected and I got told it may not work as it included the letter "ü" which is not part of the English alphabet which is why "ue" is used instead. After that issue was finally settled my document got rejected because it was not on a letter head (which it wasn't the previous day either it was simply printed in colour). I wasted to afternoons waiting for the validation to have them blame it on the University, which already told me that they are always knit picking. If I have already so much trouble simply opening a bank account I don't want to know how it would be if I'd really needed something important. It goes without saying that I cancelled the application.            
                As you may know this weekend was the Easter Bank Holiday. Before the bank holiday started i had £439 left in my account. I checked my account this morning and i realized that Barclays had made sure that 18 transactions came out of my account earlier today despite most of them being made two days before the 29th March. One of them was payment of £180 from a Private Medical Firm that I paid on Thursday 24th March.I'm seriously thinking of leaving Barclays as you just can't trust what's happening with your money.At least I have a back up option as i also have a Nationwide Account. I trust Nationwide a lot more with my money.            
                I put a cheque in with Barclays and as it was before a bank holiday I called to check when the funds would be available to which I was advised it would be cleared in my account for use the following Tuesday after the bank holiday. Given the info I used the funds in my account, only to find on the Tuesday that none of my payment (mortgage etc) had been paid and no sign of the cheque. After speaking with them I was advised by three people, One stated Tuesday another Wednesday and the third Thursday but nothing could be done to help given the miss-advised. The excuse given was that the system hadn't taken into account the BANK holidays which in itself is amazing and their people clearly don't have this info to advise customer correctly. No only have none of my bills been paid I've also wasted a day sorting this mess out. Thanks Barclays, the one time I have to talk to you and that what I got.            
                This is just not what I pay my money for. £10 per month to experience poor service over 4 calls with someone that cannot understand me and is condescending.            
                I MADE A TRANSFER ONLINE. BUT, MONEY IS STILL MY ACCOUNT. I CALLED THE CUSTOMER SERVICES. I'VE BEEN ON HOLD FOR OVER 60 MINS (AN HOUR). THEY COULDN'T CONFIRM ANYTHING. ALL THEY CAN DO IS TO TRANSFER THE CALL TO EACH OTHER.OK, FOR THOSE WHO DOESN'T WORK WITH BARCLAYS, DON'T!. FIND PROPER BANK.            
                Spoke to Chloe on the fraud prevention team regarding an issue with post coming to my house and she was really great. Lively and helpful. 10/10            
                opened an account in barclays feb 18th. Been waiting for my visa card to come out, its over 3 weeks now and still nothing            
                Went into my "local" branch (12 miles away) about three weeks ago to give them death certificate, my ID, form completion etc. 2 weeks later I received letter from Barclays asking for this information.  I rang the Bereavement Team (long wait for them to answer) to check whether they had received them yet and was told no and that I should send them further copies. I pointed out that Barclays already have copies and asked her to chase them up from the branch and let me know what was happening. (I would have called the branch too but could only ring a central number!). As I had not heard anything more, I rang again a week later (17 minutes spent waiting for them to answer) and was informed the documents had arrived that day. Over 3 weeks to transfer documents from branch to Bereavement Team site and very long delays in phone being answered.  Not acceptable and has certainly put me off ever having a Barclays account!            
                I have now been on the phone to Barclays Business support for 19 minutes. During that time they have managed to 'take me through security' and put me on hold again. It's like they are actively trying to lose customers.            
                Money Robbing Bank had a loan worth £12000 which was on a buy now pay later option. paid the loan in full and received letter from Head of customer services signed and confirming the loan is settled and account closed.after a month and half, receive another letter stating why have i not paid the monthly interest???its now on level 2 escalation and informed to Ronnie Donhelm CEO. please avoid this bank at all cost.            
                Barclays want to chanrge me 2% for withdrawing cash in Euros from my Euro account. When I asked for an explanation pointing out if I withdrew sterling from a sterling account there'd be no charge there was no answer. I intend to report this to the ombudsman. This is simply fraud            
                We had our mortgage transfered to barclays from woolwich. We are currently overseas and need access to our mortgage online. They sent us the details to do this including access codes and account numbers... we logged in once and have since had our account access suspended. Not one single person can tell us why. They pass the buck, leave us on hold and make up reasons as to why it may be. The latest reason being we don't have a barclays current account. We have never wanted one, and cannot open one as we are not in  the country. To add insult to injury they gave us an 0800 number to ring for phone banking which doesnt work from overseas. We have spent hours on hold (to be cut off) and their staff have been nothing but incompetent, unhelpful and seemingly untrained. They know nothing of their own policies or procedures and responses vary from day to day. Avoid them like the plague...            
                I wanted to get some information about opening an account with Barclays, to deposit my monthly salary into - and the customer service on the phone was absolutely appalling. I then tried the Online Chat facility on the website, to try to ask some questions, and it was even more appalling than the Call Centre. Thanks Barclays for making it very clear to a potential customer how bad the service is...I will be opening my bank account with another company, and avoiding Barclays for life. Uninformed staff who don't even understand simple questions in plain English - like "how long does it take to open an account?".            
                Having lost our son to suicide we had enough problems to deal withBarclays Woolwich made it worse.   We have been liaising with them (or trying to) over the past few months and are currently waiting to see where the 80,O00 pounds we sent by printed cheque from our executors account has gone.Every time we phone we have to wait around 45 mins on hold and then no one seems able to help.Today I phoned their customer line to ask for the number of my local Barclays.They said they didn't have one and they would get someone to phone me, no one did!Rang same number later, got the number I had asked for and now have a face to face appointment.Absolutely disgusting!            
                Not sure what is actually happening in regards to customer service in this country? (it seems to be non existent)Nowhere is this more obvious than Barclay's bank in southwick (near Brighton Sussex) you are treated as if you do not exist, 30 - 40 minute wait is the norm , This morning  5 or more staff mooching about with only one cashier open ?, 10 maybe 15 customers waiting, and no one says anything ? Except  me Again!The blinds are pulled down on the other cashiers and Barclay's staff try there best to pretend and ultimately ignore the fact there is a stream of customers waiting !!As i say you are treated as if you do not exist ,  When i spoke up and basically questioned why there was not another cashier open? one was then opened . Then apparently from nowhere comes a member of Barclay's staff who then persisted on questioning the customers as to why they were in the bank? and could there have not been another way to deal with there banking today ?With the exception of one woman behind myself NO-ONE SPOKE UP ?they just stood in the queue like sheep and continued to be treated as if they do not exist ! I was then told the wait was down to a set of exceptional circumstances ? However as i have previously stated its the norm in this bank to wait 30 mins plusSo with regards to customer service in branch banking at Barclay's or any other bank , it remains poor because we allow it!! If customers do not make it aware they are unhappy about the customer service they receive it will REMAIN poor.Personally i think the company's in question should be invoiced for the your time, yep that`s right Charge them .For sure you put a foot out of line, and Barclay`s will charge you! and if there is one thing that will grab their attention its MONEY !!!!            
                Been on the phone 1 hour and 15 mins - still not sorted ..... been with barclays since 1974 definitely time for a change, their aftercare/costumer service is non existant. .. very poor!!            
                Barclays blocked one of my international payments with the consequence that I almost lost a property bid. And with no explanation whatsoever. I tried calling them multiple times only to end up with clueless staff who couldn't answer why the transfer was blocked or what to do to sort out the problem, spent hours on the phone, A horrible experience, I feel so UNSAFE having Barclays handle my money. Avoid this bank at all cost, I will be closing my accounts as soon as possible,- Horrible telephone service waiting times- Clueless staff who themselves have to call around (spending time in phone ques) to figure out what's going on- Dangerously poor IT systems and fragmented organisation -Where is the regulator!!?            
                I had some Unauthorised transaction, but Barclays would not help me to get my money back, they said I have to contact myself personally to this company who took money from my account!!? Are you joking? What kind of bank it's this? Bank suppose to help you get your money back when there are fraudulent activities!!! I am moving bank once this is sorted, unhelpful and rude customer service even worst customer service from the branch!! Absolutely avoid this bank!!! Ps: if I could I would not give them even 1 star!            
                After 17 years of them making money off you, toy get treated with contempt while they do what they want with your money n doubt breaking at least more than one ethical banking code. So so sad... Won't be going back that's for sure.            
                We tried to bank with Barclays for about 2 1/2 years. I travel for business and almost everytime I try to get money abroad, my card is declined and put on hold. I spent hours on the phone on multiple occasions trying to resolve the issue. I've been told that the fraud team flags suspicious uses of the card. Presumably every use of the card outside of the UK is suspicious. I've tried calling them to tell them I'm travelling and have been told that it's not neccersary and there is nothing the call center staff can do to alert the fraud team to not cancel my card.All they tell me is that if there's suspicious activity they'll send me a text message. I do get these text messages a day or two after my card has been blocked. I've been left without money abroad and had my card declined at hotels.Whenever I call I'm transfered multiple times and kept on hold, with calls often taking over an hour.For other customer service requests, I find that it often takes multiple hours to get simple things done as I have to talk call center reps through every step of what I need and wait on the phone while they do it. If I leave anything with them, it does not get done.Barclays have no respect for their customers time and openly treat them with contempt.If you're looking for a bank, go elsewhere.            
                Well, for those of you that are thinking of taking out a Barclays business account; DONT touch even with the proverbial barge pole!!!. Barclays are completely incompetent in the extreme and as such should be avoided if you value your sanity!My problem began recently when out of the blue I received a letter from Barclays stating that I owed them £3600 on a business bank account that I haven't used in over 2 years. I was completely surprised at this as my business partner had put the account on hold over 2 years previous. The account at that time was left in credit, with no direct debits or standing orders. There was also no communication of any kind from the bank over this period!As our business cards had expired, I had no access to the online banking function to interrogate what had taken place sooo, I began the excruciatingly painful exercise of phoning customer service for business banking to see if they could help!!!!Well I went through all the menus and submenus and eventually I was put on hold for 40mins until finally a woman answered my call. I explained the situation to her at length and then she then asked me a few security questions, address, postcode, Rob, mothers maiden name which were all satisfactorily answered! She then asked what was the most recent transaction on the account, to which I replied that there wasn't one as the account hadn't been used in over 2 years, to which she replied that she couldn't help me any further and that I would need to see a business bank manager!!!! I asked her where I could do this and after 5 mins on hold she returned and said that I could do this at my local branch in Esher, Surrey......Okay fast forward and I'm now in a queue at this branch, with 2 cashiers at the till. 20 mins later I'm on and I ask to see the branches business manager...... to which, yes you've guessed it, there isn't one!!!So not to be defeated, I explain the situation and she  points to a phone that resides next to where people are queuing and says that I can ring customer service from there. I explain that this is no good and won't work as I have already tried that at home and that they sent me here! I also point out (and this is truly unbelievable) that I'm not going to be using the phone as it is in a totally unacceptable position and lacks any kind of privacy! I mean come on, do Barays really expect their customers to have a private conversation, whilst having to divulge personal security details etc next to a queue of people that you don't know!!!! GOOD GOD!!!!  Oh and readers you might like to know that there was a poster next to this phone saying beware of scams and not to divulge personal information!!! Truly guys, you couldn't make this up in a million years!!!Anyway,I digress, so anyway, I stand my ground and ask the teller if there's any chance that she could print out statements relating to the said account to which there was a resounding no!!!  So okay, can I book to see a business manager at another branch.... Well the nearest branch as it turns out is in Kingston but apparently he's not there very often as he h a s to flit between several branches..... and that I will have to phone customer service to arrange this!!!!! Argghhh I now begin to realise that I've two hopes of achieving this, Bob Hope and No Hope!!!So again, I dig deep and ask if there's anything they can do what so ever as im desperate and I need to understand what's going on with this business account. Okay, so the teller disappears for 5 mins and comes back to say that if I give them my email address and phone number, she c a n get someone to contact me who can resolve my situation.Soooo once again I'm asked all the security questions and personal details a t the teller point, where I'm clearly within earshot of any suspecting eaves droplets, but hey ho,I'm just to depressed now to even point this out and gladly go through the motions!So anyway, good news as at least after almost 1 hour at the teller point, I leave, assured that someone will contact me and resolve my issue!!!Well I waited and nothing the next day on email or by phone..... nor the next day.... but guess what, Its a Friday and i find a message on my mobile phone answer box and guess what readers...... it's some young lass from Barclays returning my request and she gives me a number to phone and hopes that this saves my problem....... and the number pizzas,Yes of course, it's the first number I used.... customer services!!!!!!!Anyway, have now decided to completely ignore this issue now and they can go sing !!!!It is absolutely clear that this bank is completely incompetent and I'm off to get a lobotomy!!!!P.S. if I could have given less than one star, I would have!            
                My husband and I run a small business and have used Barclay's for over a year with lackluster service but no serious problems until yesterday when our account suddenly disappeared from the Barclay's site.  The first person we talked to on the site said they could find no record of our account so it must have been closed.  Panicking over the idea of losing our entire balance of £80,000, my husband rushed to the branch.  Our account is still intact, thank god, but our access to internet banking has been cut off and they won't tell us why.  They say we have to speak to our business manager and the next appoint is not for two weeks.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  We're just supposed to tell our suppliers to wait two weeks before we can wire them payments because Barclay's screwed up??  My husband is sitting at the branch right now and won't leave until the issue is fixed, but you can bet we're also looking for any other bank to move our business to.  I'd sooner keep my money in my mattress than at this bank for a second longer than I have to.            
                Been with Barclays for nearly 3 years and I have always been happy with their services. Can't say I would go with any other bank soon            
                I have a start-up company and it's taken Barclays 15 minutes to answer my call! I asked the customer assistant (nicely) why it took so long, and of course she had a well-trained 'we have a high volume today', however I had the same experience a few weeks ago. She came back to me at 22 minutes and did what I asked her to do (finally - just one request to change my pricing plan to e-Payments!). Good grief - the total time for this call was 33 minutes - and guess what  - I'm still on hold as I type this note!  LOL ! What a joke!Call themselves a business!            
                We have been with this bank for years and the leve, of service on tbe hole is awfull we have had problems rangeing fro  someone just closeing our account down to being told my husband had remarried or i was dead you carnt phone the branch you have to speak to tje indian call center            
                A staff member had the audacity to accuse me of lying when I was in the process of applying for an account. I wanted to open a second current account as I wanted an account for purchases that was seperate from my account for bills etc. I already have an account with another bank so I thought why not try a different bank, see how the service is. Haha, boy, was I in for a shock. So I applied online for a Barclays account and went into branch...I waited 40 minutes to see someone and I had brought with me relevant ID and wageslips. During the interview to open a current account, she looked at the wage slips, looked up at me and said and I quote:''So, you're sure these are genuine?'' At which point I replied, ''Yes? I got my boss to print them earlier?'' And then unbelieveably, she followed up with... ''What, you can just walk in and do that? You can just do that, can you? I didn't know that'' She then repeated this to the point it became uncomfortable for me and her, and I genuinely didn't even know how to respond to this, the tone of voice she used was similar to that of an angry police officer. I felt like I was being accused of something when all I was trying to do was open an account and switch to Barclays. I've never experienced an employee of any company being so rude in my entire life. And it didn't end there... Oh, no. She then told me I wouldn't be able to open an account unless I transferred existing direct debits and started having my wages paid into the account, which makes absolutely no sense at all since I only wanted an account to use for purchases. I think I'll stick with my old bank and look elsewhere.Absolutely horrific customer service. What is this a police interview? Have I committed a crime? Whoever hired this person quite obviously did so to meet a specific quota. I walked away feeling genuinely offended and angry.            
                This is a bank pretending to be part of the new computer age and living in the past.            
                Opening of account I thought was nice and friendly, until a letter in the mail saying that my account was to be closed a week, without any reason. I have since then joined another bank, but received another letter from them "explaining" why it was closed."Dear Mr. WangYour complaint- Closure of your accountWe've finished our investigationThis letter is to let you know we have now finished our investigation into your complaint and to tell you our decision. I'd like to assure you that we've looked into your complaint very carefully.About your complaint.Your complaint was, in summary:-You are unhappy with the banks decision to close your account and would like an explanation.Our decision.We appreciate your concerns and would like to assure you that closing  the accounts has been carefully considered and subject to our strict internal review process.Each account is reviewed on a case to case basis however we are unable to provide you with information on the guidelines used. I have reviewed the decision which has been made and deem this to be correct.I'm sorry that this is not the decision you hoped for, but I do hope that you feel your complaint has been fully answered. (...)"Nope. My complaint has not been properly answered, neither from this letter, email, chat, visiting branch office or phone, and I doubt it ever would.If you are looking to open a bank account that you can only use for one week, with vague and/or non-existing customer service, then Barclays is the bank for you.            
                I have been trying to transfer money from my Barclays current account to the COOP bank for a week now.Initially told the code I was putting in was wrong by Barclays, so told to contact the COOP bank, tried it through a TSB account code works perfectly.Using the PIN Sentry device always comes up with error "79 we appear to be having trouble with our transaction department" So far have wasted 2hrs on the phone and 5hrs on line.System and service absolute rubbish. will be transferring the account.            
                My mortgage application was the worse experience - very bad customer service, mortgage advisors have an attitude. I cancelled my application, a mortgage is for life, I'd rather not let Barclays have a piece of it.            
                Have been with Barclays now for about 20 years and I have had enough…they have become so bad at the everyday stuff that even long term customers like myself have to go. They seem very good at charging for everything though and if they have to send you out a letter for some mistake they have made …they charge you for this letter….or "reminder" as they call it!Avoid this bank            
                Shocking customer service. I've been trying to book an appointment to open kids bank account for my son. I have waisted a whole day after going to Stratford Westfield branch and ringing customer service speaking to 3 different advisors, that can barely show interest in helping me open an account, I still wasn't able to book an appointment. I will definitely be changing my bank and will advise this to my family members and friends.            
                This isn't a personal experience from my own bank account but my other half and what I saw from helping them and their bank account.They were in the red each month and when they finally came to me for help to pay a bill I was astounded! They had a £3.5k overdraft as well as a £1000 reserve as well as a £4k credit card and £8k loan.  Everything was maxed out and the charges just keep wiping out any progress made. I looked at the accounts and saw that the loan had been upped from £6k only a few months before.  Totally irresponsible lending and profiteering company.  As soon as the CC was being worked to pay down more than the monthly minimum they got a letter saying their credit limit had been increased - Totally unreal!Needless to say, I paid chunks off and they paid me back in full and now all the barclays accounts are closed (still took 2.5 years) apart from the loan that has front loaded interest so it made no difference to close that account as you still have the pay the same amount back regardless!            
                It would seem the Barclays owners are more interested in riddling their branches with machines & any interest at all in customer service has been long lost in a mess of new branch procedures. Expect long wait times, disinterested and unhelpful staff and fellow frustrated customers all around. Luckily I only have to visit barclays for business banking - never in a million years would i ever hold a personal account with this bank.            
                Absolutely horrible! Hastings branch Staff are rude, very pushy and nosy! After all I left with disgusting aftertaste of discrymination. I will never recommend to anyone. Experience bad enough to make me thinking of changing the bank.            
                The level of service is absolutely unacceptable at most branches. Half of the employees I talked to don't even know how to basic things, like printing personal statements, and if you need their help with anything - good luck, it will be a huge waste of your time and may not result in anything.            
                Who ever come up with the idea of doing away with cashiers? I don't want to deal with a machine and the few staff that are still present are rude and unhelpful.            
                I needed to do an International money transfer that I was having trouble doing online. I arrived as Barclays at Flitwick were closing, however Edward let me in and completed the transfer for me. Its been years since I have been in a bank and it was great to meet someone friendly and prepared to spend 20 mins with me, after the bank had closed on New Years Eve. Thanks Edward To            
                no problems what so ever, one of the easier systems I have used.            
                Made a payment to my barclays account using FPS. 24hrs later and still no money. Rang up to be told that it should take around 3 days for the money to arrive. Barclays accepts the Faster Payment Service. The money should have been in my account within 2 hours or the same day at the very latest. Customer sevice doesnt know anything. I think it was a mistake opening an account with them. Will switch elsewhere.            
                We have a business account with Barclays & have tried to set up online banking since November 3rd? I've tried online, telephone & in person at my branch - each time to be told that all is in progress. I'm still awaiting as of 22nd December for a pin/membership no in order for me to do this, I set up a formal complaint 6 working days ago to be told this morning that nothing has still been actioned - I have wages that need to be paid - how can a bank offer a "Business" account that can't pay it's staff!!!!! I have never dealt with such incompetence & will be seeking further advice. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BARCLAYS TO ANYONE.            
                Have been trying for nearly two months to sort out a problem with my debit card. Each time they say it's sorted, and each time it isn't. Must have spent a total of days now waiting for them to answer the phone. Seriously thinking of switching banks. Barclays used to be one of the better banks but has gone badly down hill in the last few years.            
                Refused to pay out when our bike was stolen, even though my neighbours' co-op insurance did in exactly the same circumstances.NEVER USING BARCLAYS AGAIN AND ADVISING FRIENDS TO DO SAMETotal waste of money            
                I called to report a fraud on my debit card, after 2 hours on the telephone just with the same message and music telling me to wait, I gave up as not operator answered my call.            
                Took out a new barclaycard for balance transfer, the card arrived in 2 days which is the highlight.Website is inadequate for 2015Barclays charged me for 2 balance transfers and 2 x feesBalance transfer not paid to old cardOver 40 minutes on hold on phonePhone automated service is quite frankly pathetic and not fit for purpose.So yeah, 1 star for this amazing service            
                9th Dec: I have never been a Barclays customer and never wanted to be one, my current experience validates my thoughts. So I unwantedly became a customer after Barclays took over ING Direct mortgages. Back in June I logged in online and managed my mortgage. Today i tried the same and the online site states "You need a saving or current account with us to manage your mortgage".So, for the first time I called the help desk to sample their customer service. Once through after a while on-hold, the off-shore team told me they would transfer me to the off-shore online team. This team told me to call back in half an hour without even listening to my issue, I refused, they gave me a number that wasn't free to phone and told me to call back so i asked to speak to a supervisor. The team member then transferred me and 3 minutes later I was cut off. Now onto Barclays via Twitter, unfortunately after some discussion they asked me to call the help desk on the chargeable number... back to square one. So I have a mortgage I cannot manage with a company that were not my choice. I'll try a bit more, but if no joy and I cannot manage my mortgage anymore, the financial services Ombudsman awaits.10th Dec: After some pointless discussions with the Barclays help team on Twitter such as "Were you given an ID and login details?"... Well of course, how else would I be logging in ?, we have reached a point where I asked for a free phone number for the help desk. They then said it is included in my calling plan I have; how the heck do they know what phone plan I have ?. Anyway, the number given is not free to call, so I have asked for a second time. Let us see how this customer service journey transpires.So the final Tweet from Barclays is that there is NO free phone number for their customers to call when they have issues. Long and short. If you want effective customer service, choose a company that does not off-shore it. A really poor customer service indeed.            
                I have just had my card cloned.  Never happened before but with over 1k of transactions in the day, I was worried by the whole thing.  I got through to the customer service line within 2 minutes, the advisor stopped the card, refunded all the transactions, explained what would happen next and  was generally reassuring and trusting.Gives me faith in the banking system!!            
                Website difficult to navigate and update, seldom fully functional and when I call I often wait a long time and get after a while 'the other person has cleared'.  Today I've just had enough of the same, I've finally decided to change my business account away from Barclays.            
                It has taken me over a year to downgrade my current account from a pay monthly account to a standard account. After many calls and complaints the account has now been downgraded, but it has left a very sour feeling. None of the customer service/complaints staff showed any care at all, always being fobbed off with lies that they would be in contact with me. After 15 years with this bank enough is enough, out with the old!            
                Having problem with my online transaction. I called a month ago the guy told me it's their bank system problem, try to process again the next day.Well and I tried to use my debit card to do online shopping again few weeks later it still couldn't process.I went to the bank but the staff couldn't see there is anything wrong with my card and asked me to call again.I just called and he spoke poor English with extremely strong accent which I could hardly understand. After asking me so many questions in order to check "if I was the card owner" he decided that I was not the owner and deactivated my debit card. Honestly I didn't even feel safe when he was asking me too many questions even my mums name and my regular transaction with my bank card.Thank you very much Barclay to employ such unprofessional employees. I have decided to cancel my account. It has granted me a happy weekend without my bank card! Brilliant!            
                I cancelled a transaction on my card an payment was still taken. On saturday my son was hospitalized 50 miles away by his own dad and i found put from police. I rang barclays explained situation and that is was a emergency as i needed to get to my 16yr old son. I rang back sunday to be told dept is closed ring back monday bearing in mind my son is 50 miles away alone an scared in hospital. Rang monday was told to go to branch an request they upgrade my acc so i can borrow money to get to my son have to wait 14 days to raise dispute, rang tuesday was then informed 15 days, rang today dispute was raised an now being told i have to wait up to 2 WEEKS for a refund. No one told me this during week when i rang!! Complaints team were rude "well what do you want us to do" my poor son is in hospital and i cannot get to him again because i was informed wrongly. Thanks to barclays my 16yr old spent 2 days in a strange hospital without his mum by his side!! Myself and my children will be taking our custom else where im am beside myself with worry and so angry with barclays WORST BANK EVER they quite happily take your money but wont give it back even i a emergency!!            
                from a high street bank you could trust to a bunchof horrible nasty people in 30 years.is money grabbing and self interest to be put before customer service,by what should be a customer service company ?we have had 22 months of hell made worse by barclays and allthey want to do is blame us for their failings.never go near these if you can help it            
                I have been trying to open a bank account in Barclays for more than one month. The costumer service in  Crouch End LONDON was horrible and the Girl trated me soo bad. I am and European Student and actually they almost ask me a VISA and a SPONSOR. I get that English people don't feel themselves inside the European country, but I cannot accept that the costumer service handle with EU citizens as the were immigrants as we live in the same community.ANyway I had a second appointement booked, that they cancel because they have trouble with some machines, and the people hadling my procedure said she would call me back for another appointment ... NEVER RECEIVE THAT CALL.So I had to book again an appointment throug their PHONE COSTUMER SERVICE which was horrible the first two time, where they wanted to book me an appointment after three weeks, and at the end I found finally someone who booked for me an appointment immediately.Today WITH TWO OFFICIAL ID DOCUMENT, a PASSPORT AND AN IDENTITY CARD I COULDN'T OPEN MY ACCOUNT as they won't accept my passport as they "couldn't check it" and my ID because is not in plastic ( AND ACTUALLY I WON'T NEED A PASSPORT TO TRAVEL OR LIVE IN UK AS EUROPEAN SO MY ID SHOULD BE ACCEPTED EVERYWHERE AS OFFICIAL DOCUMENT) I can't receive money from my work as I don't have a bank account AFTER ONE MOTNH AFTER APPLICATION.MY experience is really frustrating and horrible since now.            
                I made a website to share my story.barclaysbankreview.com            
                Regarding a bereavement case, I visited a branch on 2 occasions. Both times to verify original documentation, received response within days. Always helps to not have to worry about whether your requests are being actioned. Even got a PPI refund on the deceased account without having to make a claim. Really pleased and grateful that the service was so efficient!            
                I cant find words and Im shaking I just want to scream at them            
                I went to barclays !!!!<<5>>!!!!! times to open a bank account! One time they wouldn't accept my id from greece which is european id and they shouldn't have any problem, i went there with passport and they wouldnt accept my NINO cause it was a photocopy, i went with the actual paper and they wouldnt accept it because it was "expired"! How can a national insurance number be expired when i only applied for it 4 months ago. Unbelievable, I wouldn't recommend this bank to anyone, its like they don't want new customers! My friend had the same problem too. Just don't go to this bank.            
                I couldn't access my online account. I called twice, both times, it took several re-directs and about 20-30 minutes on hold. The first time, when I finally reached someone, they took me some security questions where they asked me about street names and individuals that I am supposed to know (who they somehow know that I know). I failed and was determined to be, not in fact myself and was not permitted to try again on the same day. A couple days later, I called in again and after another 30 minutes on hold, it was determined my account had been "locked," for unknown reasons. How hard is it to get access to your own money?            
                Seriously useless. Never answer the phone, on hold for ages (30mins+) and when you do get through, you get through to India or somewhere. the person does not understand your problem even though you try to explain. You are passed from pillar to post with out and explanation as to why or to the person who eventually takes your call. I cannot run a business like this!!            
                This bank really doesn't care about there customers.  I urgently needed a new pin sentry for online access, I contacted customer services online but I was told I needed to get to a high street branch which was not possible as barclays had shut my towns branch. I sent barclays a complaint and later received a email saying the pin sentry device was being sent by post and would arrive within 5days,  12 days and still waiting.  I really do advise everyone complaining about barclays to change banks. It is really easy to do as the transfer bank takes care of moving all your direct debits etc. And there is a cash incentive of £125 with some of the best rated banks such as first direct.  This is the only thing barclays understands LOSING MONEY NOT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.            
                Very poor service. No receptionist. You feel lost the moment you went in. Nobody to welcome you, show you where to wait or even say you will be attended soon. You just find your own space to sit down, you keep looking at staffs passing by but not even a single word from them. Was this trained staff? What a disgusting service. Train your employees! I didn't expected this for such a famous bank.            
                Can I just say how disgusted I am with Barclays. I have been a loyal customer for several years. Firstly, my main issue is that I requested via telephone to change my account from a current account plus to a current account. Then, I realised that I was still been charged for that account several months later. Then, whilst speaking to one of your customer service advisors, a lady changed my current account plus to a standard account. She failed to mention any of the terms and conditions and as a result I got heavily into my overdraft. I opened a complaint with the complaints department and after a great deal of effort, I was able to obtain a refund. I was also promised a refund for my phone bill due to spending hours on the phone. This was back in August. I waited a few weeks to receive my £40.00 I was owed for the telephone call. Then, I rang up again and I was transferred to someone by the name of Ian Cants in the complaints department - he is a senior colleague apparently. He told me that he would give me a refund if I emailed him with a copy of my bill. I did this immediately. It is now the 19th of October and I still have not received my £40 refund for my phone costs. I have rung up Barclays on numerous times asking for answers and I have been promised phone calls which have not happened. This evening - I decided to give it one more shot before I permanently close my account. I got through to the complaints department after 1 hour only to be told that there is no notes on my account in regards to the £40 refund for my cost. Regardless, the gentleman I spoke to opened up a new complaint and was about to refund me the £40. Suddenly, after being on hold for 30 minutes - the phone was disconnected.I ring up again - this time waiting 30 minutes to get through the complaints department. I had to explain the complaint all over again in regards to my £40 phone bill. I explained to the lady that I had spoken to Ian Cants. She put me on hold and apparently went to speak to him. She comes back on the phone and claims that Ian Cants has no recollection of speaking to me and they will not be able to refund me the money. What I find disgusting is that no staff in Barclays seem to record the conversations they have with their customers. After 6 years, it looks like I will be going to find another bank - but I am disgusted - especially to the woman I spoke to in the complaints department who claimed I had been untruthful and seemed to be making the whole situation up!Please sort this out Barclays or you will lose ALL of your customers.            
                When my late mum left me some money ,i wanted to buy a little place in Spain that i in turn could pass onto my children ,I asked Barclays Bank to change it into euros the rate at the time was 1.64 to the pound, i was promised this in branch,when i collected my 101k of euros they said the person had left the bank,I was £3000.00p short of Euros , i tried and tried over the years to get answers without luck then it came out Barclays had been fiddling for years. I reported this on 1st June this year and still getting fobbed off, with comments it with head office then its with legal dept. please dont let Barclays Bank cheat you. David.            
                Had my wallet stolen and had to ring all my banks to cancel cards, including First Direct, Halifax and Ulster Bank. Of all of them, Barclays are the worst to deal with by a long way. Rude, unhelpful staff who speak poor English and present too many hoops to jump through. Only thing to get me through security is to have memorised transactions on my account - as if people do that. So I'm stuck without a card and access to my account. Compared to first direct: English operator answered in one ring and within 2 mins promised a new card in 2 days! If the others can do it why cant you Barclays? You've made a very unpleasant experience even worse. Looking to move my current account away from you.            
                Only wanted to change my name and barclays made this almost impossible. I also bank with several other banks and the for the other banks all I had to do was go into store with the right documents and they did it there and then. With barclays I was told I needed an appointment and there was a 2 week waiting list!!! I made an appointment for two weeks time and then when I arrived they had no record of my appointment!! Ridiculous process for what should be a very straightforward change.            
                I've been banking with Barclays for 8 years. 8 years of terrible customer service over the phone and shocking interest rates on products they offer me although I've been behaving like a model citizen when it comes to managing my finances for years.            
                I have just got off yet another very long and fruitless call from the Barclays team. I'm sure Barclays would love to have all my cash accumulating in their coffers, but I don't trust them an inch with it! Whilst I always speak to someone who is pleasant and polite, my call is always transferred to an overseas call centre. The operatives have clearly not been trained and don't have access to all of the systems they need to be able to give out the correct information, which results in misinformation and frustration. I feel sorry for them, as they have clearly been given a script to read and are helpless to try and resolve any issues that aren't straightforward, and therefore correctly advise customers. The end result is a very unhappy banking customer and a call to the complaints team...time and time again! I am now looking at other banks, or possibly to just move everything to my building society who actually care about giving their customers a good service, and aren't so complacent to think that customers won't vote with their feet. Beware of Barclays, there is a reason they do not rate well in customer polls!            
                To be honest I wouldn't even give it any stars. I gave several chances for Barclays but it is just not meant to be. I tried to open a bank account, first one in the UK as I am new to the country. In the beginning it was very hard to get a proof of address that was accepted by the bank, but that is generally like that in UK. The first disappointment was with Barclays Customer support. I booked an appointment over the phone for a Saturday, they offered me several options, I picked one and put it into my calendar 3 weeks in advance. The operator was about to give me reference number, I asked him to wait for a time so I can write it, he said it is not that important so he basically pushed me to end the call. When I went to my long avaited appointment it turned out that he booked it an hour earlier. He also didn't send any confirmation. I had to rebook, now for two days later. I took off time from work, went to the bank, I brought my letter from NINO office for proof of address that was previously checked by a receptionist at one barclays and customer support also confirmed that it works as proof of address. At the appointment they told me that it is a temporary NI number so it does not work. I rebooked the appointment again.Finally I got to the Cheapside branch with Ryan Sparrowhawk. It went fast, in fact Ryan didn't care much to provide information in a way, he seemed to push the apointment. After completing a form he sent me off that I will get a call back within 4 hours with my account details. I didn't. I called Customer support the next day, I was asked when my application was submitted. I told them I have opened a bank account yesterday. The cust. sup. representative said the account is not active yet, btw asked me ' Hey mam, if you applied yesterday, how do you expect to have a card today' - I was asking my account details, not the card. Not to mention how rude he was. This was three weeks ago, still haven't heard from it.In the meanwhile I opened an account with TSb two days after I called Barclays Customer Support asking about my account details.My partner also had bad experience with them and I would highly recommend to pick any bank but Barclays. They should invest more into customer support, training employees, processing applications - basically service - rather than marketing and ads.            
                Wanting online access to a charity's bank statements I approached the local branch, who couldn't help but gave me an email address.  Two attempts by that route produced no response so I wrote to Customer Services in Leicester - well who would want the frustration of the call centre - but two letters have produced no answer either.  Next stop another bank.            
                Words can never describe my frustration of this terrible place. They are incompetent and terrible company. I noticed that I was being double charged for the same items on my statement. When I called on the weekend the agent advised that I call on Monday because "that" department was closed. I called on Monday and basically I wasted my whole day going in circle between agents and departments and getting my calls disconnected with them. At the end and after I wasted my day I asked to speak with a manager. She finally fixed the issue. On Tuesday I noticed another charge was still not fixed so I called again and another manager transferred me to another department that they promised to have this issue fixed. I WILL NEVER USE THIS CARD OR ATTEMPT TO USE ANYTHING RELATING TO BARCLAYS. STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!            
                I wanted to transfer some money from my account to another payee. What I thought would take half an hour or so online, took the best part of an afternoon and morning due to misinformation from several members of telephone banking/branch staff. During the last phone call I actually cried because the process had become so frustrating. I'll be transferring my money to a new bank that cares about its customers as soon as I am able to. That's if it doesn't take another few hours for a bunch of incompetent idiots to help with a simple task.            
                We transferred our company accounts to Barclays Business in March 2015. We then went through a long process (2 months work) of changing our details for invoice with all our clients (around 80). Money started going in to the account, however, there was one significant floor - we couldn't transfer any money out. I have spent 40 hours over the last four weeks on the phone to Barclays and probably the same the month before. Our business manager in Birmingham (Mike Falkner) completely washed his hands of the issue saying we needed to deal with the online team.Today 16th September we have been informed there is a glitch in the system and Barclays do not know how/when this will be resolved and they have advised that we close our account and go back to Santander. This answer was only achieved after four hours of arguing and had they had their way the glitch would still be undiscovered.We estimate our loss at around 20k and that is before we go through the process of changing back to Santander and updating our clients. A formal complaint has been raised and they expect to come back to us in eight weeks.If you are a business thinking of switching to Barclays approach with extreme caution and don't change anything until you have tested your account for at least three months.Also like most others we have experienced the expected misinformation, rudeness, inept managers etc. These issues are not isolated, this is a systemic problem running through the core of Barclays. They are aware and don't care.            
                I am dealing with barlcys with a case of money being stolen from my account after 9 meetings and 4 weeks still no refund when they promises online that they will refund. Can't say how bad they have treated me.            
                I called the customer service line through my banking app in order to set up a new payee, after confirming my security details several times I was told that I couldn't set up a new payee using the phone banking and that I should do it online with my pinsetry. As I was at work and didn't have my pinsetry with me this was obviously not possible. As I needed to make the payment immediately due to an emergency waiting until I get home wasn't an option. When I asked for an alternative the customer service adviser told me I should withdraw cash from a machine and give it to the payee in cash!!!!! Really?? Worst customer experience ever. I'm definitely changing banks.            
                I have never in 28 years of buying and selling properties and dealing with mortgage applications ever come across such a shambles of an organisation. From losing all our supporting application documents. Letting us think that the they had everything they needed to make an offer. Then A week later finding out that the application has been put on hold because they need more documentation. But no-one can clarify what it is that they need that they don't already have. Being kept on hold for 25 mins at a time, promises to call back  not materialising. To the broker intervening by getting their area business development manager involved who himself in addition to the under-writers dealing with the application is also not responding to our calls. This application has been in play 9 weeks. I am 24 hours away from losing £1,000 reservation deposit because of their incompetence. I would recommend never ever  applying for a Woolwich mortgage from Barclays.            
                I've had an account with Barclays for over 12 years, I've never gone overdrawn once, I wanted to request a £100 overdraft, couldnt do it online so used the online chat service, I was told as I had taken a payday loan within the last year my account was blocked from being allowed an overdraft!I'd taken out a £200 payday loan and paid it back within 3 days due to a car emergency.Blocking customers as standard policy is nothing but rude, the person 'clair' who was supposed to be customer friendly was nothing but blunt and rude, she even told me id asked why I wasn't allowed an overdraft, My question was why cant I apply online for one.I've now applied online with another bank and moving my services elsewhere, 12 years loyalty has only gained me to feel stupid for staying with Barclays.            
                I had over 2k  taken in error from my current account by a member of staff who was supposed to be taking it from savings! Result was we were overdrawn for the first and only time due to Barclay's own mistakes. Problem was put right when I went in, very upset and complained and charges were reimbursed. Personal banker was very good but counter staff very defensive bordering on rude! Since then I have had to ensure I repeat myself and get confirmation of everything I ask them to do, in any branch and have still had to endure misunderstandings, lack of attention to detail and poor, careless staff just short of making more mistakes.            
                Barclays unilateral decision to remove the ability to download multiple account statements simultaneously is a hugely counter productive step for business owners and personal customers alike. People now have to complete several downloads instead of one. Not very smart thinking Barclays! Time to look for another account. Tried to complain but the complaints team were useless. Totally ineffective customer service Barclays - SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH.            
                If you enjoy rude customer assistants, a website that is fundamentally unreliable, a pinsentry device that does not work thus preventing you from logging on to your account, lousy interest rates, having paymenst blocked for no reason and no explanation given then bank with Barclays. I do not so I shall leave.            
                My husbands card was frozen even though the funds were readily available in our joint account. Banked with Barclays over forty years! Had to call fraud team offshore so many times to be told, it's ok now. Well it isn't! Time to switch to a company that values its customers and gas a UK call centre!            
                Basically, nobody on the end of the phone knows how to do their job properly. Endless waiting, misinformation and empty promises.            
                worst customer care ever - get put on hold for up to 20 minutes at a time to be transferred to another person to ask same security questions over again and then put on hold again. My  debit card not working when ordering online, so now i had to wait for them to send me another one. They telling me that is nothing wrong with my card, but I still can`t place order online. ..SOOOOO anoing!            
                Ordered a new card on the phone. Told ready for pick up next day.  Went to bank at lunchtime to be greeted by a sea of machines and all cashier booths removed. After a wait of 30mins I'm told have to arrive at 2:30.   explained im leaving the country next day and manager shrugs and says they give incorrect advice on the phone.  Why bother with Barclays time to switch.            
                Unhelpful bank... Phoned up for an account problem and over a space of 3 days i was told 7 different things. I visited the branch in the end and was told i could be helped, all i needed was my passport.  Went home and returned to be told theres nothing they can do. Just forget barclays they great till you have a issuee and then they are rubbish.            
                worst customer care ever - get put on hold for up to 20 minutes at a time to be transferred to another person to ask same security questions over again and then put on hold again. Then to be told the transaction will be processes to find that it has not. I will be moving yo another bank very soon.Giving one star is being over generous - minus would be more accurate            
                SO RUDE AND ANNOYING. Im going to metro bank.            
                Website, log in, and everything what i try to settle is a problem !            
                We have a business account with Barclays Bank and this has been in operation since December 2012.Last week a fraudster managed to get our telephone banking pass code and managed to set up a payee on our account. We do not understand how Barclays staff stated that we must have been careless with our pass code when we have never used the system.Secondly the fraudster tried to transfer £900 which was stopped. But instead of helping us Barclays has frozen all our online banking and mobile banking until they establish how the leak happened. They have not communicated how long it will take to rectify the issue but when we rang the fraud team an irate lady told us that it can take up to 20 working days. Is this reasonable in this day and age. We are suffering because we have no way of checking whether the clients have transferred their payments and we cannot release the service. In last week our turnover has dropped by 70%. We put in a complaint to Barclays but once again an irate gent rang us and told us that until the investigation is done to establish where the leak is from we cannot do anything about it. He said that Barclays is trying to protect our money.            
                Tomas Rahm, Jesse Rodriguez!!!! Recognise these names Barclays? U should because your bank has provided accounts for these two aliases who are scamming openly on TROVIT in Australia selling cars and then not delivering. These two supposed gentlemen are one in the same and have ripped me off to the tune of $19000 sent to your bank in Lupton! Your fraud investigators have returned a "we can't do anything verdict" and have no intention of returning my money and vehemently protected the account holder known as Tomas Rahm here in Australia who poses as a soldier on assignment to Afghanistan and in a hurry to sell his car. Unfortunately I was stung big time and now have to explain to my family why some other thieving low life has our money!   Barclays Bank service is lousy even when you can find someone who can speak some form of English, tardy and cloaked with an arrogance tempering disbelief. Barclays Bank do not have any consideration for hard working people who have been swindled by customers of Barclays Bank! I think the term is called money laundering and Barclays roll out the carpet for these conniving bottom feeders!. Likes attract I imagine!! Want the whole story? Let me know and I will supply an exhaustive list of evidence collected over a two week period via emails that show how Barclays treat victims as the perpetrators! They have no quarrel in closing an investigation when it seems that their banking responsibilities fall into question. They told me "refer it to the Banking Ombudsman if you want to waste more of your time and theirs or the police-look in the phone book or online -we don't have the time to assist-thank you for calling Barclays Bank". I don't mind if the media jump on board on this! My $19000 lost will be pittance compared to what this sham outfit should lose through customer and business defection to other banks and what it's going to cost to rebuild their image-What a joke!!!!!  Please don't hesitate to contact me -It's the sole item on my bucket list and I want to repay Barclays Bank with the same caustic and negative treatment they thought was acceptable to treat my case!!! Let's all feed it to these gangsters so they do not continue to allow their clients to operate outside the law. Put Barclays out in the public arena, the spotlight and let them endure some of the rubbish they enjoy putting others through! I would give my left arm to see this hit the headlines!!!I really would like to get some public action on this fellow reviewers! It's time Barclays Bank was outed, made responsible for their actions, their questionable account holders outed and brought to account and some form of compensation plus damages expected from both! Name and shame! Expose those who hide behind the cloak of anonymity!  Let's get a public movement happening and media putting pressure on these out of touch monoliths and the illegal customers they patronise and protect!  Facebook, tv, news, print everything! Let's tell Barclays Bank their actions are not in touch with public expectations and those people whose life savings are lost because this bank cannot be brought to account! I want my money back, you want your money back, we all want back what is legally ours!!!!!!!Barclays Bank ; who are Tomas Rahm and Jesse Rodriguez really? Why do you maintain their accounts when you know they are fraudulent and scamsters? Don't believe me? How about I publish their account details like the one that I transferred my $19000 to which promptly disappeared? I've still got Mr Rahms details and can send them to anyone who would like to know them including the UK Banking Ombudsman and Scotland Yard since you did not deem it necessary and would prefer to walk away from your responsibilities. Can you believe a Fraud Investigations Department within a bank such as the esteemed Barclays that would not think it important to mandatory notify the police about such account holders within their bank nor make any attempt to track where funds have been transferred to after they have left their bank? Delivers a new meaning to the concept of Duty of Care!!!!! More media fodder but hey Barclays deserve every bit of negative feedback and consequence coming their way! Happens when you lose touch!            
                really poor from such a big bank, have had a few nightmare experiences that really should have been avoided.....            
                Twice I've phoned up before I go on holiday to advise I'll be out of the country and possibly using my card. Twice Barclays have blocked my card. Twice I've had to call up from abroad and wait on hold for at least 45 minutes to get resolved.            
                I've had a Barclays current account for 11 years and a business account for 4 years. I've held a lot of money in that time with Barclays and always been a loyal customer. I heavily rely on the mobile banking app to manage my accounts and to pay people (including MYSELF a salary!). I can no longer do this because I have a rooted phone. What a joke. Rooted devices aren't any less secure than stock devices. In fact, if anything it's more secure thanks to the anti virus and malware apps I can now install because it's rooted.Unfortunately for Barclays, TSB are getting my personal, savings and business accounts and currently in the process of switching them for me.            
                Thanks to the guy who's just hung up on me on purpose which I knew would happen as soon as I started ringing and it took over 20 minutes for him to answer (great customer service) been hung up on SO MANY TIMES from Barclays Customer services ! What an absolute blimming joke! Employees should be sacked for hanging up on customers or being rude etc. Calls should be monitored in order to prevent such AWFUL Customer service. Will not be staying with this bank any longer I am sick of it!            
                Barclay Bank cards are rated highly for earning travel awards but heaven help you if you are overseas and need help -- because Barclay's won't.For the second time in two years they have replaced my card (their initiation) without informing me in advance.  They start by postal mailing the new card to my address of record, even though I have informed them in advance of my travel plans.  When I call them to discuss it, they act surprised to find out I am abroad and that I won't be back home to pick up my new card any time soon.Last year I went two months with NO CREDIT CARD at all as I was stranded overseas when they nullified the old card before I received the new one.  They sent three cards to me overseas the first two being useless because they fail to allow for sufficient delivery time.  Then they express surprise when the card does not arrive in time, even though you have told them the amount of delivery delays usually experienced.Just now they have repeated things.  I only now learned they have already mailed a replacement card to my home address, even though they had been previously informed I will be away for months.  They say they'll give me thirty days to use my former card -- let's see if they have any ability to get a new card to me here overseas within that time.  I have my doubts.            
                I have banked with Barclays for the very last time, the worst service I have ever received. I have never in my life ever experienced such poor level of service. I simply cannot speak to any advisors as they always hang up the phone. The advisors have ridiculed me and then laughed at me whilst I expressed my genuine concerns. I have closed all my bank account with them including my business banking. MY current account is still not closed even after visiting a branch and requesting closer and having this confirmed. Now on top of this they are intending to charge me interest on a 0% balance  ?? how does this even work. I have no alternative but to report these criminals to the FCA. If only I read the review on the Bank before trying there service. I have seen that there are many people experiencing the same problems. STAY WELL CLEAR            
                So many options, so many changes of latest look, I dont even know if Im still on the same website .... now I cannot even get my latest statement????? Is it THAT complicated???            
                Terrible rates and unable to cancel - choose another company.  For £800.00 we lost out at least £50.00 worth of euros had we gone with the best online interest rate - we will not use Barclays again for foreign exchange.  Next time will go with trust-pilot reviewed best rate company.            
                I find it appalling that you find it acceptable for your staff to lie to customers as long as they do not put it in writing! It's absolutely disgusting!            
                Ok so today I wake up to find my account overdrawn. On Friday my aunt paid in a cheque for a large amount for my birthday which is very soon. When I ring the useless mangers call centre staff, based in India ha ha. To be told you will not be able to access any money from you account till the cheques is clear. So let me get this straight someone pays a cheque into your account and then the bank stops you getting to any money you did have in there. To protect you, what a joke. But hey it's ok for there ceo's to commit fraud which they have now sacked to mention no names. So a bank the is happy to commit fraud, then accuses you of it and stops you getting your money to protect you. As soon as I have my money Barclays can take a run and jump my account will closed. I would say to anyone thinking of joining them to think twice. Yes you get a nice swanky personalised card but good is that if you can't get your money. Or pay for things in a shop. Not to mention the embarrassment. when it's declined.Enough said.........            
                worst experience ever. had to prove my address. I have send them my proof of address three times. they are still not convinced. All those monkeys are constantly telling you the same things. nobody is actually listening. Feels like you are talking to some kind of robots.            
                I recently lost my debit card whilst out shopping. It took me 45 minutes to get through the automated telephone system to report the card list and put a stop on it. When I finally got through to the right department because I was unable to give an exact amount of a recent direct debit (only out by £25) he was unable to process the request and was so condescending in his attitude I gave up trying. Drove to the Walthamstow Barclays who put a stop on my card immediately. Absolutely terrible experience of telephone banking service.            
                10 years ago I purchased in Spain using Barclays Bank Spain for a mortgage. AFTER A YEAR I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM VALENCIA THAT MY PROPERTY WAS ILLEGAL and must be demolished. A SECOND letter arrived some time later informing me that it was my responsibility to demolish my house. I asked the bank for my documents and the INITIAL SURVEY was MISSING. It took me a long time to get this document as Barclays Spain refused me access until I went to the EU.MY PROPERTY WAS AND STILL IS ILLEGAL and this is CLEARLY stated on my Initial Survey. I wrote to Varley, Agius, Diamond, Walker and to this day I never had an acknowledgement or reply.TWO of my letters via Varley and Diamond were sent to Spain for them to investigate themselves and they said "the mortgage was given on the architects cert. as it said that my property was OVER FIVE years old and was protected by Spain's Aitiquity law BUT MY INITIAL SURVEY CLEARLY SHOWS THE OPPOSITE saying that my property was NEW and not protected by this law. Also the property had no permission to build, no licence to build, was built on farm land which had to have over 10,000 sq. mtrs. mine has 1500 sq. mtrs. Was registered in Dolores "but the registration shows severe differences to the actual property.THESE TWO LETTERS SENT TO SPAIN WHEN ANTONY JENKINS WAS THE C.E.O. of Spain (2009 to 2012) I often wonder if Barclays Bank Spain's Fraud, Corruption and bribery was mentioned to the "select" committee when Jenkins was made C.E.O. of Barclays Bank UK?I know that I have enough evidence to show that Jenkins had a reason to sell Spain at a loss of £300 million. This when Spain is building more and thousands of licences have been granted to build.Not a bad decision to SELL A CRIME.Wonder what the shareholders would say????Haven't made my mind up about McFarlane yet as after all Barclays Bank Spain was sold when he was in the Chair.            
                Barclaycard have possibly been the worst nightmare of my life when ever I rang, problem, they never seemed to be able to sort anything out nothing they every explained made any sense and in the end I started to refuse to speak to anybody , it was so bad I've just cleared mine and my husbands cards of they did mine ok but yet again caused problems over my husband never again  may god strike me down            
                And that basically wraps up my true fillings about everything that has to do with your unbelievably stupid way of dealing with your customers...!!!            
                I have tried for the unmpteenth time to process a transfer of funds from my account to my son's account in France, using online banking service. The first time it would not accept the full SWIFT 11 digit code so, following a look for information on the internet I entered the first 8 digits, which was validated by online banking. The process was not smooth as it kept freezing and I had to start the process over several times. Once complete the funds went out of my account but were returned next day. My local branch informed me that I should have used a 6 digit SWIFT code for France. They also advised that for this kind of transaction I go into the branch. Really!! What is the point of online baking then? On return home I tried again. It would not accept 6 digits so phoned bank. Whilst on hold I tried entering the full 11 digits and this time it was validated. Telephone banking said I will not get my fee of £15 returned as I should have used 11 digits in the first place. When I explained that it came up with an error with 11 digits on several attempts he then tried to blame the problem on the French bank. I asked to be put through to complaints as I felt any other business would give a refund for faulty services. Whilst on hold for an eternity, I typed in a complaint on the online system as I had run out of time and needed to go to work. Over the years I have had to complain 3 times to Barclays and in each occasion my complaint was not dealt with despite several attempts on my part. I would not recommend anyone bank with Barclays and I am changing banks shortly.            
                It feels like they are working in slow motion , i am literally waiting 40 min to take some money out of my acount and people are leaving the bank with there heads down because of your slow service ... Friday morning and you have only 2 employees omg .            
                Barclays customer service is atrocious money has left my account due to fraudulent activity I had to fill out numerous forms to get this money back and had to argue with many of your staff, I then got my money and a month later it then gets taken back out of my account, so I then take a trip to speak to a personal banker at my local branch who advised me that he had opened a complaint and if I don't get my money back after a week to call you again, I then phoned again after 1 week and spoke to someone who advised me that I wouldn't be getting the money back as it never left my account even though it shows it on my statement and I had been advised that fraud department had made a mistake and would be refunding this, I then asked for her to get back in touch with the fraud department who I then spoke to and they advised me AGAIN that they were in the wrong and that they will contact the case manager AGAIN so that I can get my money back and I still have not received a call back or my money. I cannot believe that a bank that I have been with for years can treat me so badly and I have truly lost confidence in you. Every time I ask to speak to a manager or someone with authority I get told that they are either not available or in a meeting. This is such a frustrating situation and I feel like I am getting nowhere with it as i just seem to be getting fobbed off every time I call. I hope that people see my message and decide that they wont use you as the people they trust their money with as it just seems that you really don't care about your customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            
                Sept 2012 I bought  Samsung Tablet and download the Barclays app. For two years or so I used this with no problem, then had a problem with the tablet, meaning I had to reset it, losing everything on it. I therefore had to reload the Barclays app, which was fine, apart from the fact that Icould no longer pay anyone. I made various phone calls, no one could give me the answer, then one person rang me back, saying it was a security thing and after ten days the app would update and once again I would be able topay Barclaycard etc. After two weeks this had not happened, so more calls and I was told a member of the technical team would call me. No one ever did. XYesterday, 18th June, I went on to the app to be met with a notice telling me I needed to upgrade the app via Play Store or similar. I went into Playstore and the app wasn't there.  Many phone calls and visits to the bank later I have found out that the app is no longer available for use on tablets!! I bought my tablet so that I could use apps, Barclays online banking being the one I used the most. Now the only way I can see my bank details is to go via Google, which is much slower and nowhere near as clear. I am told the only way to get an app again is to buy a smart phone,van ipad or change banks. Having used the app for over two years, why has Barclays made a backward step to penalise android users like this.            
                I find it difficult to put into words just how disappointed i am with Barclays Mortgages. We have banked with Barclays for 15 years with no issues but their mortgage application and underwriting service is abysmal! We ran through our mortgage application with an advisor on the phone, based i believe at their Leeds Office, not only has he proved to be near on impossible to reach but the couldn't care less attitude of the front line customer service staff when trying to obtain an update has been really poor. Our application has now been with underwriters for 2 weeks despite the promised timeline of 48hrs, this is partially due to Barclays seemingly being unable to request more than one document at a time, and kindly giving us the wrong address to send our original documents to. I finally thought we had a breakthough yesterday when I rang for an update and was passed to the Underwriters in India it seems. I was told they had all they need and a decision would be made today. I duly called, only to be told that our underwriter isn't there today as the weather is bad...better wait until Monday...            
                I hold Power of Attorney for a family member who has an account with Barclays. When I attempted to register the government-verified paperwork with Barclays so that I could manage my family member's account (she has early-stage dementia and lives in a residential home), Barclays made it a very long, drawn-out, and stressful process. I tried calling their Power of Attorney customer service number, only to be told that they would not speak with me because I was not the main account holder (?!). They refused to even acknowledge that they had received the Power of Attorney paperwork/if they were processing it. There was a lot of telephone-based shrugging and passing the buck. I ended up lodging a complaint with the Executive Complaints Team. After many calls and emails, the Power of Attorney was registered.After a few weeks I was issued with online banking access to the account, and telephone banking documentation. I was told that a debit card would be posted out to me. After three further weeks I still had not received the debit card. I emailed Barclays, who did not respond. After a few days I chased the query up, and was told that the card HAD been sent out, but that it had been sent marked for my attention to the residential home that the account holder - the family member I hold Power of Attorney for - resides in (I don't live there....it's a home for old people. I'm 33....). Which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The card never surfaced, and I was forced to contact Barclays again to ask them to cancel the card, just in case it fell into the wrong hands. I'm still not entirely sure that they have cancelled it, and I am without a debit card.I am now experiencing an online banking glitch. I filled out the online banking query form via the online account, and received an email saying that they could not talk to me about the glitch because I was not the account holder and it would not be "appropriate". I was told to call them and that they may be able to help me then. I have just spent 15 minutes on the phone to their online banking team (based in India) and they do not know what the problem is or how to solve it. They were completely clueless. I have been told to expect a call back from their technical team (no timeframe given). Do forgive me, Barclays, if I don't hold out much hope on that one. I also asked about another issue with the account (re: PINSentry) and I was again told 'I don't know' and that they would put in a request to the relevant team to deal with it. I have also had to register the Power of Attorney with my family member's other bank - Britannia/Co-Operative - who have been extremely helpful, transparent, and courteous throughout. Dealing with Barclays has been frustrating and upsetting. I am so glad that I don't bank with them personally (and never will after this).            
                This Bank does not deserve its status - although it does desrve its falling reputation. Still locked out of my account after 5 days. They promise to ring back but NEVER do! I will be moving back to Santander...            
                I used to bank with Barclays over five years ago but was advised to change banks due to a DRO (Debt Relief Order). One of the reasons I started getting into debt was the ever increasing overdraft and "unauthorised" overdraft charges I was getting not to mention the letters which they charge £20 for or whatever the charge is for them. At one point I was paying charges on a charge for another charge and it totalled up to a huge £88/month! I was ALREADY heavily in debt to the bank and I had to miss a rents payment putting my flat at risk. And the online banking is useless. You can only view a few statements to a few months back-unlike LloydsTSB which can go back YEARS!!!Also unlike Lloyds, immediate transactions take two or three days to appear online. With Lloyds the change is almost immediate so it is easier to see what your finances are like at a glance at any moment in time.And one final thing that used to irritate the hell out of me-and they probably still do this is putting a RANDOM stop on your Visa debit card WITHOUT telling you!!! (I think they do this for fun to wind you up) So I have been made to look like a fraudster in front of others when my card is declined several times!!! When I used to call the bank they said that 'a block has been put on your card' with no reason given and NO apology. Then I have to wait 24 hours for the block to be removed before I can use the card again. The amount of times I was made to look like someonew trying to pull a swifty when it was because the bank put a block on my card wass really annoying! In the eight years I have been with Lloyds, they have never triedd this WITHOUT telling me first.The above and Barclays charges are one reason I wouldn't recommend them. They also appear to charge for just USING an acccount-personal, not business. Again Lloyds do not.            
                I had to use the telephone banking services for Barclays I was put on hold for 15 minutes after the lady couldn't help she transferred me to another department the telephone operator knew that he was unable to help but still continued with his useless formalities instead of assisting me in a time of need Barclays hang up on me... "Or let's say the call dropped " ...  I then called again and surprise surprise was put on hold again for 10 minutes ... I was finally able to make a simple transfer ! But it took me a total of 30 minutes , raised my blood pressure by dealing with such inconsiderate people and spent a total of 10 pounds 34 p on my phone ... Was it worth it ? Self explanatory            
                Newport- Isle of Wight branch. Numerous members of my close friends and family have had issues. Over the telephone, one couple were told exactly what they needed to bring to a meeting to open an account. 1× I.D was requested. Upon arriving at the meeting, the useless customer representative said that they needed 2× I.D. When asked if they could print something off, they were told the it had to be printed at home. I'm assuming that the penny it would cost to print it would have put Barclays out of pocket. Either that or the petty manager takes some kind of ego trip from expressing his power over printing arrangements. Either way, a very unprofessional and unhelpful service. Whatever happened to wanting to help people out, I don't know, maybe because it's the nice thing to do?Another incident involved a friend arranging a meeting at the same bank with the same useless representative and upon arrival was told that the representative was off for two weeks. Hollow apologies followed. I would feel dreadful about messing someone about like the and do all I could to put it right. Seems like Barclays Newport branch think it fit to allow a bunch of immature cowboys to handle customers money and accounts. Dispointing to see what the world of customer service is coming to. I'm sure previous generations would be disappointed. I hope to never have the displeasure of dealing with such people. Will spread the word. You see, unprofessionalism doesn't go unnoticed and a bad reputation is hard to lose. In the end, it will be you at Barclays who will lose out. Who will lose.            
                The overdraft chargers are disgusting 75p  a day I see Barclays more as a loan shark or pay day lender than a high street bank in my opinion  you complain they don't listen I have since changed banks            
                lying agents and complaint managers 1) Ravinda -2) Christopher haze3) Mandy brown4) Debbie Williams All lie through there back teeth  to people they try and fob you off with £50 then £100 then £150 just to stop you complaining and shocking service shocking complaints underling Neva will I deal with this bunch ofupits again no wonder the country is broke            
                Barlcays online banking .. broken again .. call the help number to quote error code ... 9 minutes of entering information like my sort code etc until I get through to a person.  Then security questions, ok fine.  Then they tell me the problem is resolved, all I need to do is log out and back in again.  I do so, same error and error code, so she says she will arrange for a call back for me from another team.  But before she can authorise my call back (PS this has now been a 15 mins call during my lunch break), she tells me she needs further security .. wants me to tell her about a recent transaction, who it was to and the value ... what? why? Why when Barclays online banking is broken am I the one having to jump through hoops??  Idiot at end of phone does not even understand that if I had hacked this account sufficiently to provide all the information I had already given that providing that extra piece (which merely evidences that I can see the account) is not securing that I am who I say I am!!!  Moronic.  Computer says no.  Don't bother employing people Barclays, these foreign call centres are full of people terrified to use their own initiative, making computers an equally attractive option ... is this the long game you are playing??            
                Had an appointment at 2:30pm at Barclays Brighton. Got there 5 minutes early. Queued for 30 mins before someone told me appointment would be another 15 minutes.This is despite having to book a week ahead and one email and 2 annoying text message reminders.This would be fine if they didn't make me wait 45 minutes!            
                I am a business customer of Barclays and recently enquired about a business loan. The business manager said I had already been pre-approved for a £12,000 loan and if I logged in to my online business account and then clicked on pre-selected offers all I needed to do was answer a couple of questions and that would be all.So I logged on and I clicked on the pre-selected offers  only to see a message to say there was a technical issue with this page and try again in one hour. Well you can guess 36 hours later and the same thing. So I phoned customer services and was told they have been aware of this issue for months they even asked me to use different servers like google chrome and internet explorer but nothing worked in the end they said they had no time frame of when this would be resolved.Barclays are a multi billion pound company and for them not even fix the issue nevermind not knowing when it will be fixed is ridiculous. As a business customer I don't have the time to be on the phone for over an hour for an over the phone application..... Having the £12,000 offer was due to me running my business correctly. Also having previous loans that I paid off within a year, hence them pre-selecting me.In the end I have gone to Paypal who have given me a lone in 15 seconds for the same amount. So well done Barclays absolutely pathetic!            
                While checking my bank account online noticed a couple of payments had been taken for a company I had never dealt with.  Rang customer services and explained the obvious errors.  The lady was rude, disinterested and at no point did she say my card needed to be cancelled and a new one issued!  She came back on the line after checking my account and during that time the company had taken another payment!!!  She did not know what procedure to take and said I would be making a complaint. I found the company concerned and they said I had to email them any info I had and they would look into it.  I was so annoyed and wondered why it was that I was having to act as go-between, it was not my responsibility!I rang barclays back and said I was making a formal complaint, including one against the original customer service staff I spoke to.  T he manager was very concerned about the way I had been treated.  He cancelled my card, refunded all monies that were wrongly taken, gave me £25 as an apology and said the member of staff would be investigated. I have been with the bank for over 35 years and realise no one can be trusted - not even banks!            
                I have a little problem that why reason are review            
                I have to use the website for day to day banking, making payments etc.  The website is dreadful, blank screens when trying to save payments (that it's taken you half hour to add!), slow response keying in data, website doesn't pick up all characters typed in, loads of miscellaneous error codes.  This is so frustrating for a business account when you have hundreds of transactions to put through a month, my private banking websites are amazing (Smile and First Direct). Customer service is also appalling for dealing with Barclays online, just get passed round from person to person and none of them can actually help anyway, time for a change we think!            
                Barclays were my first ever bank and up to 2007, I remained with them. Initially I had no problem with their services, until I became a student and had a student account. Thereon, three things happened that soured my previously placid view of the bank. I'll explain all three in detail:-------------------------------------------------------1) Mismanagement of my current accountPrior to starting my three-year university course, I'd alerted Barclays to my situation - with all valid paperwork - inside my local branch and the assistant changed my account accordingly. At that time, all student accounts had an option of a £300 fee-free overdraft, which naturally I took up. The new student card and necessary paperwork were sent subsequently. Everything operated as normal until end September 2007, when I was due to start my second year of university. I'd travelled to Scotland for a week a fortnight before resumption and calculated that the overdraft, at the time, would cover me while I waited for pay day from work. However, I was confused when I returned home to a letter from Barclays claiming I was in the red with additional charges. After a few phone calls, the last assistant I spoke to asked me (rather patronisingly) whether when I'd opened my account I 'just assumed' I had an overdraft. Even though I'd already explained I had a student account, I reiterated that fact and - to my horror - she revealed my account was a standard one. When I challenged her on why that had happened when I hadn't finished university, she said nonchalantly she didn't know before suggesting I returned to my branch to re-open my account as a student one. Subsequently, I wrote to Barclays about this incident with a request they refund me for their erroneous overdrawn charges but I never received a reply, nor a refund - or any seeming concern. Eventually I was compelled to close my Barclays account and move my finances elsewhere.2) Deceptive response to fraudMy account had been subject to a card cloning fraud, which I noticed from a statement where two alien items were on there totalling almost £250. I visited my local branch and spoke to an assistant that, after constantly asking if I was 'sure' I hadn’t made those transactions, called the main HQ and afterwards, told me that my card had been blocked and I should fill in some paperwork to send back to them, which I did. While waiting for the outcome of the claims, I received another monthly statement where I saw another alien item had been charged to my account - an account that had since been 'blocked', you say? When I returned to the branch and spoke to another assistant about the new fraudulent payment and my previous branch visit, the assistant appeared shocked that I'd been misinformed and decided to block the card herself in my presence. That time, it had been, I was sent a new card as a result and I got my money back - but I didn't forget having been lied to by the other branch assistant.3) BarclaycardI also had a credit card with Barclays. However, shortly after I closed my current account and despite me always paying my credit bills well over the payment limit each time and AHEAD of time, Barclays wrote the vaguest letter to me in mankind claiming, to the following effect, that 'after routine inspection of customers' accounts and activities, we've decided to suspend your account. Your limit has been reduced to £0.00 and you should continue making payments to clear your outstanding owing amount.' Upon reading that, immediately I hopped onto online banking and transferred my remaining balance to the credit card of my new bank, as I wasn't to give Barclays any service whatsoever after the rather disrespectful way they managed my accounts. Given how almost immediately this manoeuvre happened after the initial closure, I still suspect it was done out of spite.---------------------------------------------Even if one has been with a company or service for years, that company still has potential to undermine the trust of its customers. Loyalty is not worth a grain of salt and especially with banks such as Barclays, it never will be. As long as they have your money.If you are a new customer or considering switching banks, I would confidently recommend you avoid Barclays.            
                Open a new account and get online banking which works on the first day i use it, then it stops i call up and my account does not exist and i need to go to branch to sort out internet banking??????I call customer services and they are not taking external calls until i rant down the phone. then suddenly they are!But they still cant there back sides with both hands and say i need to go to the branch. and hang up the phone. Just put in for a switch on the account to a new company as i dont want to deal with these idiots any further            
                Not even worth one star to be honest but here's my take, Cardiff branch in city centre (07/04/2015), made me wait for 45 minutes then told me they would not process my query as they would take too long and to come back tomorrow.. also with attitude as English is not my first language and and they spoke to me like I was a piece of rubbish with disrespect. As I left  their colleagues were glaring and smirking at me, presumably talking about me which was very rude and unprofessional.            
                Take money from your account and sends it to offshore accounts and then don't even replace the money they take.£400 went missing (literally in my account one day and out the next without even a single description of what happened to it) out of my account... nothing on the statement and apparently "no bank error".However! if a payment you arrange to come out on the 1st is reserved by the bank on the 23rd of the previous month but you don't get paid until the 27th they will charge you £8 for not having the money in your account. ALSO they refuse to give me an overdraft after being with them since I was 9 years old.... Never been in debt at all - there is just no reason for it.They even stole £68 which was supposed to be paid to Virgin, it came out the account but virgin said they never received it. Bank said they "reserve the right to take money from existing accounts to correct debts in credit cards or loans which have not been paid" the thing is I do not own a credit card or have ever taken out a loan....            
                I went to the same cashpoint I always use in Stoke and the machine said script error and went onto a desktop screen so I went inside they said that they will sort it out so I waited then got told I can not have my card back because they don't know my intention on that card and that I could be using it in a dodgy way so I explained what happened on the account and they spoke to me like I was a piece of rubish and I explained I need the money for my child and was then told your not getting it back you have no Id I so I showed them the id and then they took the card and cut it up the team at this branch are complete and utter disrespectful and I would like them to be formally spoken to and given a suspension no one should ever feel like a criminal in a bank full of people sick people you have working there.            
                I opened a current account with Barclays some years ago, as a package deal with my mortgage. I didn't have a choice, it was a T&C of the deal. I didn't really use the account, so destroyed the card, for security reasons. In January 2015, I needed to start using the account, for the purpose it was set up ( To pay off my mortgage). So, I had an appointment with bank, to get a new card etc, on 15th January. They said that I couldn't do that,as the account was inactive. It was happily taking my money, but I was unable to draw out,as had no card. They promised to sort it out & order a card to be sent within 7 working days. After another visit to branch & several phone calls, I got fed up with waiting on 2/2/2015, so asked for it to be investigated. No response, so phoned again on 27/2/2015, to be told that account had been closed on 2/2/15, but it was still taking my money. Asked to make a formal complaint, but managers don't take phone calls. So, I was told everything had now been organised & I would need appointment at branch, to show I.D etc & card would then be issued. Went for appointment today, with a card that I received in the post this morning. Was told that card was no good, so they cancelled it & started to process for the card I needed. The assistant then stated, that she was from another branch & didn't have any information, so I was sent away, yet again, with another promise to sort it out!!!. So, I am back to square 1, with no card, money in my account, that I can't use & an account happily taking my money. It beggars belief, how a company can be so incompetent. Worse, if they don't sort it out soon, I will be in arrears with my mortgage & have to pay extra interest. I'm disgusted.            
                In branch, no problems except that they can't actually achieve anything beyond the simplest deposit or withdrawal. The customer service department in India is woefully inadequate. Apart from the language and cultural barriers, they do not appear to know how Barclays works (if indeed it does)! The online banking service, frankly, is sh*te! I have never been able to conclude a single transaction without irritating issues, lockups, lockouts, etc. The layout of the website must have been designed by a five year old...poodle, and every time they 'improve' it, it gets worse. I'm off to RBS.At least they are openly dishonest!            
                I joined Barclays end of last year for my new business.  I figured it was a free account year one, and then lower fees than my previous business bank.Im sorry previous bank ... all is forgiven ... Im coming back!I spent half an hour on hold yesterday, trying to pay my suppliers. I gave up.  Called back.  Another fifteen minutes.  Told it was sorted.Today same issue, but all payments being delayed.  Spent half an hour holding because EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT was delayed (for security reasons!!!) ..gave up .. called back .. spoke to a Lady in Northampton ..like most of them very friendly and doing her best but stuck with a system that doesn't work,Finally have spent 50 minutes manually paying each of my suppliers...and still can't get a couple done because the system is now suspending my online banking membership .. THREE TIMES IN A ROW!Best advice she gave me, at the end "Switch off and come back in an hour, and hopefully it should work then" ....That it .. Im done.  Bunch of clowns.            
                Called Barclays telephone banking as my local branch was closed, just wanted to ask a simple question about a transaction I made the day before.The overseas helpdesk agent did not initially accept my security credentials so I asked why, the agent then proceeded to rant on for a couple of minutes about security without answering my question, the whole attitude was very unprofessional and a complete contrast to the branch assistants. After a further 7 minutes of getting nowhere I was finally told the team I needed to speak to only work Monday to Friday.So unprofessional, will never use again, what are Barclays playing at ? we are paying for better standards than this, a complete waste of time.thanks for readingCJ            
                DO NOT BANK WITH BARCLAYS IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE. (We don't as our mortgage is with Barclays.)They haven't one iota of a clue about customer service.Their processes are a shambles - we have not had a single administrative transaction complete without at least one and often several complaints being needed.Their poster in the local branch saying how they listen to customers is a travesty of the truth - these days if you make a complaint, they will no longer actually respond but will only note it for their consideration.And a bug in there computer system which confuses "balance" and "cleared balance" causes standing orders to fail if I pay a large cheque into my current account - still not fixed after I complained formally about it several times over 8 years ago.So, if you are looking for a new bank, steer clear of Barclays at all costs.P.S. I wanted to give them zero stars, but apparently you have to give them one - which is one more than they deserve.            
                Disgusting third world customer service!!Don t have a clue what they doing plus no apologies,they never call you back as they promise!            
                other day i rang barclays  just to transfer money within my own accounts, indian support girl took 20 min and failed to do the job.its unacceptable service shame on you barclays, your online service is sh****t ontop no one to help in customer support close it and bring it back to UK            
                The worst bank on the highstreet. Do not bank with these guys.            
                Used to be able to open and close accounts online and manage my OpenPlan savings settings in online banking. Last year I tried to close an account online - can't do that - you have to phone them. Called them - major problem at the call centre, please call again later or go to your branch. Went to the branch, only to find they can't close the account either - has to be done via the phone. So they had to call their own call centre! And they ended up having to wait an extra day as well!This year I wanted to update my OpenPlan savings settings only to find that option is not longer to be found in online banking. Sent them a message. Their response - sorry that option is no longer available in online banking you now have to pay for a phone call to their call centre to accomplish the same thing. Did they inform me of this change before they made it? Nope. Did they inform me after they made it? Nope. I only discovered it when I needed to use the service only to find it had gone! Unacceptable! What's the point in online banking if you can't do things when you are online! Oh yes, the point of online banking is to show you lots of adverts for banking services they can charge you for! Silly me...            
                Definately for the second time one of the worst customer service I have ever had.It's the second time that I call Barclays Bank to understand my issue and the second time that they put me trough a recorded voice that takes me over 10 minutes to understand a small issue like an unrecognised debit on my balance. Without answer obviously. The line went down as long as my credit finished and they didn't even call me back.Very poor customer service, very long call for a small issue like asking the details of a direct debit, asking me twice my bank details even if I have inserted them before manually upon request of the recorded voice.I am so disappointed that on my barclays account App on my IPad,  which is very well programmed  and appears very nicely, my transactions never are on real time. Never. It's so easy to go overdraft without being notice of it.I apologise for the negative review but I hope this would be helpful to improve this service.Thank you            
                When I transferred to Barclays about 15 years ago the service could not have been better. Fast, efficient service in branch and a business manager I could walk in to see. He disappeared after a year, not to be replaced.The website is awful. Often foes not work. Error messages give a number to call where an automated system asks for date if birth, account number etc... How do I know this us genuine?Phone any Barclays number you get the same. Wait to speak to a human and you could wait for ever. The telephone service is woeful.My local branch is a delight. If you want  to wait in a long line while the 2 clerks ( if you are lucky) work at the slowest pace imaginable. Every so often a person drifts around with an ipad but any query made to them results in the same answer--use our free telephone over there. And yes, you're back to the same telephone service described above.Occasionally a person achieves a result but that's as rare as hens teeth.Find a better bank? Do they exist or are they all as bad as one another? At the end if my tether with Barclays.            
                Following separation from my Partner I approached my mortgage company Barclays about either A) Buying her out or B) Seeing how much they would lend me. I had an agreement in principle and could choose either option. I decided that we would sell the house and move on.I duly put the house up for sale (unfortunatley with an agent/contract with 'Able Willing etc clause') and a few months later (after the initial DIP had expired) we agreed a sale and I found a property I wished to buy. Again for a second time I went through the decision in principle process and again was accepted.Completed/Signed all the forms and returned them to Barclays.Barclays then passed application through to the underwriters and the application was declined. The application was declined citing a problem with missed payments on a credit card some 3 years earlier (during a dispute with MBNA, note no defaults took place). Financially I am easilly able to pass the affordability tests and it is purely the dispute with MBNA which has caused this decline at full application timeI have been with Barclays for the present mortgage for 17 years (never missed a single payement etc), and other than the MBNA episode have an exemplary credit history. I haven cleared quite a lot of outstanding debt (car loans etc) prior to the second decision in principle being granted, so am in an even better position than I was at the first applicationI'm now potentially left with a bill for £3500 pound for failed sale of my property (not to mention a battle with ex partner) and solicitors costs if I pull the plug on my house sale (not to mention the purchasers loosing their survey money etc) or having to move out/effectively be homeless with a 15 year old son, and potentially into rented accommodation if other mortgage lenders follow the same track as Barclays did.To say that I currently despise Barclays for this decision would be an understatement. They were fully aware about my credit history (as I disclosed this dispute with MBNA to them at both DIP applications) and their actions in all of this is nothing short of negligent.I will be fighting this all the way to the Ombudsman and beyond. Mortgage lenders should not be able to change their mind from a DIP to full application due to these reasons. They have not shown due diligence at the various stages of the application.I hope this post acts as a warning to others thinking of applying to Barclays for a mortgage. There are other lenders who also fail to show due diligence at the DIP stage. I would never have put my property up for sale had I know at the initial DIP that I would be declined.            
                We originally took out a mortgage with ING Direct. They were subsequently taken over by Barclays/Woolwich. Since this transition our experience dealing with them via the call centre has been a joke. We do not have an account with the or credit card but they always insist on asking us for our sort code. We have, apparently, a mortgage membership number. We have been trying for some time now to set up our online banking so we can view our mortgage statement. To date and having spent hours to a call centre in India this has proved fruitless. This company is a joke. If you want a mortgage DO NOT BANK WITH THEM. Again... this wasn't our choice to do business with them. If I had known ING would sell up I would have gone elsewhere. AVOID.            
                I have been with Barclays for around 5 years now it have never been able to get the most out of my account due to the inability to meet with an advisor in branch because of major anxiety issues.I spoke to a lady called Shauna today and she was so helpful and polite,I told her what difficulties I was having and she arranged someone to meet me tomorrow to help get the most out of my account and improve my credit score.Really delighted with the service today!GrantScrap that.They never turned up for the arranged appointment,never called or anything.I rang up to ask what happened and the advisor told me my branch doesn't do home visits!!I asked why did they book me in and she said to call you to arrange appointment....ok so why didn't they call me either?She said she will arrange for them to call me the next day and again I heard nothing.Absolutely shocking shoddy service !!            
                I've been with Barclays for 13 years now, and have never had a problem. Last year I had an issue with paypal where my account was hacked and a substantial amount of money was frauded from my bank account. I went to my local branch and left confident that the issue was going to be resolved. The gent sat me down and answered all the questions that were on my mind, and even helped me make a phone call to paypal to make sure they were going to do their job on their end.            
                I have consistently had the worst customer service from Barclays.Phone banking teams, usually from India, don't know what they are doing, one advised me that a drawdown from a mortgage offset would cost me 60% in interest a year!  When I queued and went in a branch, I was informed that would actually be the current mortgage rate which is 1.25% a year.Frankly how a supposedly reputable bank can hire people who don't understand English, and are happy to give out totally incorrect information is beyond me.  It really is Mickey Mouse banking. But I have also had very poor customer service in branch on occasions.Currently I've been waiting for phone banking for the last 30 minutes.They put all their money into the online banking area, which is good, but the quality of their service elsewhere is terrible.I've moved my current account and credit card to Santander, who actually seem to give a damn.            
                On hold for hours waiting to get through to a call centre in India, that provided no resolution whatsoever. The best they could do was give a contact number of a relationship manager back in the UK. They could not go off script, be proactive or show initiative. They were completely unaware of any of our business details.            
                I have been a loyal customer to Barclays for nearly 9 years and had to say that this is the last straw for me after a couple of bad experiences.First of all I went into branch to request a same day replacement card as my local branch does that kind of service. Twice of which I didn't get my card replacement same day because one the equipment broke down and two they unintentionally refuse to give me it after I showed them ID instead they ordered a replacement by post to my house which I didn't want.Secondly I wanted to upgrade to a current account of my choice and filled in an online application. Which then said I have to phone up customer services to arrange an appointment at my local branch so I'd give them the day I want to be in and said they'll phone me back by that day, which didn't happen so I phoned them back again and again and their response is something like they didn't know about it.It took a while to wait for a operator to reach to me both on the phone and love chat.Anyway I am switching banks now and I think my time with Barclays is done for now.            
                Over the past 9 years, Barclays UK has managed to shock me with its failure to look after me as a customer. Where shall  begin? Let's start with the time i went to Australia for work and despite reassurances from my local branch that my debit card would work, as it should in the current time and age of the world, it didn't in fact work, at all, ever. I called the help desk and was led around a wild goose chase for someone, anyone, who could at least provide me with the means to sustain myself financially for the remainder of my sojourn. A debit card was indeed sent out to replace the one that had been blocked, but it was sent to my UK address and it was there that i found it, a year later. Shall we talk about the Online Banking facility? I am left speechless by how unacceptably bad this 'service' is, in a time when online banking is a feature offered by all banks across most of their accounts. I have not been able to log in once since October 2014. The time i manage to speak to someone at the 'help' desk, i am asked to go to the branch with ID to prove i am who i am. I make it to the branch only to be told there is nothing wrong with my online banking and that a new debit card has been sent out for me. Why? Who knows. A week later, new card in hand, i try to log in again only to once more face the same error message and a screen that tells me i have been locked out due to security reasons. I am closing my account as soon as i can afford to pay back the loan amount i took out last year. There is absolutely nothing this bank can do for me.            
                Paid a bill through Barclays Stamford on 6 Jan 2015, 9 days before it was due.  22 days later the payment had not been received by the company I was paying.  When asked why it had not been paid, the branch operative said it was probably a clerical error.  I asked if she could check on the computer if there was a problem, but was told they would investigate at first opportunity, and they would resubmit my payment, using the red slip the payee had sent.  Apart from the embarrassment this has caused, it has also cost me in telephone bills and petrol, and I still have no answers as to why it wasn't paid within the three working days that they say it should take to pay.  I am surprised they still have account holders, if this is the way they treat people.            
                Tried to open a business account at Barclays. The issue was in a transliterated version of my name (note, I'm from EU). The manager refused to open an account, though I provided all proofs of my original name spelling: ID, Passport, Law and Utility Bill. I've been trying to convince him for 3 weeks, no chance. Opened an account easily in another bank. Barclays - never again.            
                Spent over 30 mins on hold with a repeated "Sorry for the wait, we will get you to a member of our team as soon as we can"THEN THEY TOLD ME THE ONLY WAY TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH AN ONLINE LOG IN ISSUE WAS TO GO TO THE BRANCH!!!!!Whats the point of online banking if I can't log on and need to go to the branch to sort out log in issues???            
                I work away often, as they ask you to. Tell them when and where your going so you can use your card. I follow that every time. I go away and instantly first purchase cards blocked. Ring them supposed to be free, I have never actually gotten a free call to them from overseas. Always charged. Out of 8times this has happened once it was sorted over the phone.Every other time I was told go to a cash machine and enter pin. In the UK. I'm in Canada for 2 weeks that's not possible.I was told sorry we can't help.I was in Cyprus working and for several months they couldn't send me a card out as Cyprus wasn't covered, so I had to get it sent home then to Cyprus.I've had bills and charges that's built up over £200 and they say they can help me, even though I told them I was using card over seas. Not once did they contact me as there supposed to and ask if it's me spending my money overseas.When I've had problem in the UK and rang them, they never do help.If I had time I would change banks after using barclays for over 15years.            
                Just been on the phone and hold for over 30min for an adviser to tell me that their specific team that needs to speak to me do no operate on weekends. Spoke the line manager who don't understand anything I say and very unhelpful. I have been a long standing customer of Barclays but the customer service has gone good to really bad hence I have decided to close my account with them            
                good phone service, polite an very helpful            
                Called them 2 times and they could not help. Ordered a new PIN for online banking and it did not arrive after 10 days.Went to the bank activated PIN senty, then i was able to log on online banking set up a new PIN code and now i can log on on both ways.The help desk never suggested something like this and they are HELP !!!            
                Outrageously bad!! The only people that can access this branch now are people with a degree in I.T, and when you just can't cope with the equipment any longer they provide a rude member of staff to really kick the boot in by telling you off for not using it corectly and doing their very best to make you feel totally stupid!! Well done Barclays!! if you want the really bad customer service award, you just won it!!            
                Money has been taken from my account without my authorisation, i pay account fees to protect me against theft  and yet they can't (won't) do anything for 15 days, however in 15 days time they will investigate and see if they can retrieve the stolen money!!!I can safely say it has made my mind up with whether to close my accounts with them, what with the increase of computers and decrease in real people in their branches and the lack of protection they are giving me ......... I WILL BE CLOSING ALL MY ACCOUNTS I HOLD WITH THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.            
                Blocked my card as I tried to make a payment to someone. Spent ages on the phone on hold finally got through to the call center answered all the security questions was told that my account had been blocked and i had to speak to the fraud department, was put on hold again only to be told that the fraud department had clossed? It was only Saturday afternoon! So now I've had to waste another 25 minutes trying to sort it out again. Im not filled with confidence that this will not happen again! :(            
                I have a small but growing and profitable business despite banking with these jokers.   Latest in a catalogue of poor service is that my debit card and all direct debits have been out on hold while the bank tries to contact me about some activity on my account.   My account is run immaculately but clearly something has them in a huff so after apparently trying to contact me since November they have unilaterally blocked my business account and therefore my business.  The genius of Barclays business is that your account manager keeps his telephone number a secret so you can only deal with the drones at the call centre.   I have evidently received a handful of missed calls from an unknown number which is then saying that they have tried and failed to contact me.     What happened to voice mail or email or a letter requesting that I contact them urgently about my account.  That would mean giving a phone number which would break their secret squirrel policy of not wanting to be contacted direct.  In other words I have an account manager but it's a secret who he his or how to contact him.  Still waiting for them to call me - I am now in Thailand 7 hours ahead and my phone is likely to keep going to vociemail - which apparently is a crime in Barclays lah lah land. I get the distinct impression that I exist to make my bankers life easier. Any one thinking of setting up a business and being lulled into a relationship with these people - don't.            
                On the last 2 occasions I have attempted to check my current account online the service has been unavailable. No explanation other than the catch all generic "sometimes due to updates and service" is offered. Well Barclays must be doing a lot of servicing!Once was frustrating but stuff happens, twice is taking a liberty and galvanises me to check the oppositions provision.            
                I've been with most banks, Barclays are by far the best my only problem is the site reliability. Maintainance is fair enough but it's quite regular and always when your money goes in or out around midnight. Please Barclays, start work at 2am-6am so people can make sure money is in or out before you start work.            
                CLosed my account w/o warning! and was toold that I dont have money left in my account and they wont give out statements-- MONKEYS!  I Have almost 15k in my bank account, now filing complaint through ombudsman.if you value your money avoid this scammers            
                Barclays online banking has changed - again!  For the better - definitely not.  You can't get to where you want to be.  You have to scroll down miles to see the information you require. Downloading statements is a complete joke with two pages of "helpful information" at the end of every statement.  And page numbers of statements are at the bottom of each page - how convenient.  Get a grip Barclays.  Online banking is supposed to make things easier not complicate things.  Whoever came up with these "improvements" must have done it with their eyes closed.            
                Frustrating and useless. I tried to switch to Barclays since it offered some products that my main bank did not. After trying to use Barclays for a few months, I have now discovered that if I have the audacity to require paper statements then Barclays compensates for this inconvenience by making it impossible for me to also view such statements and transactions online. Trying to obtain transactional information between infrequent paper statements then requires multi-hour sessions lost within Barclays' maze of call centres. I am not sure how to describe politely such customer service policies. I can suggest that potential customers seeking proper service look elsewhere.            
                Have been going around in circles following online banking entry instructions and getting nowhere. Tried the online chat and was told I was in a 7 min queue. waited 7 mins and then the message came through that the operator had cut me off.  Total waste of time.            
                Requested today at my branch a renewal of my VISA Debit card because it expiring while travelleling abroard three months from now. Did ask specifically whether I could continue using current card, which the branch clerc confirmed. Was faced several hours later with the fact that my allegedly still valid card had been blocked. Would be only half as bad if I didn't have to board a plane tomorrow, with no cash, no possibility to pick up a booked rental car on arrival, or pay for hotel etc. Have been trying to reach so-called 24/7 customer service without sucess for the past 2 hours, having gone through three rounds of 1/2 hr wait on the phone, before slamming the receiver down in unabated anger.            
                I've been a Barclays customer for years and have been using their telephone banking service.  All has been ok until one time I found out that despite calling and making a payment to my credit card the payment wasn't completed.  I decided to give online banking a try.  Since joining about 3 months ago, it has only worked once.  I am so shocked at the pathetic system which I would say if I have tried logging on 100 times, it has only worked on 2 occasions.  Barclays you should hang your heads in shame.  By comparison, I have a Santander account which works brilliantly.            
                ING was the best banking service I've ever had.  Barclays is the worst.  As a result of their grotesque incompetence a fund that I set up to support my profoundly disabled child has lost its income.  But that's ok because they're paying themselves huge bonuses and fixing the currency exchange.So many more things to say but I'm exhausted by it all.            
                There have been a few times when my card has been randomly blocked and I've had no explanation for it.Last time I went into the branch to see if I could extend my overdraft, the people in the branch were very lovely and very helpful. However, when I needed to talk to someone on the phone both the people I spoke to were very rude and patronising. In the end I wasn't allowed the money I asked for because one of them actually attached a note to my account saying that I tried to get money for Christmas presents. I didn't, in fact Christmas was just one of the things I mentioned among food for 2 months, books for my course and travelling home. I didn't not appreciate the way I was spoken to at all.            
                I got moved from ING Direct (who were great!) - I am now stuck with terrible service - lost of time wasted - very poor advice and phone disconnected by them many times.            
                Long story short: Friday night,  find card is not working.  Spend 2 hours on the phone between 4 different advisors to find that the new card they sent me at the beginning of the month was only valid for 28 days... For anybody who has read the other reviews here it will be no surprise to know that a)  the card had an expiry date of 2017 b) no correspondence had been received informing me of any 28 day expiry,  and c) why would a new card only be valid for 28 days?!?!  Clearly the reason was complete bs.Their call centre drones are so indoctrinated and robotic that they can't possibly admit that it was completely and utterly Barclays fault. To make things even worse,  after wasting 2 hours of my time to unblock the card,  the advisor suggested I thank her for rectifying the issue!! Really!!   I'd love to think this was lost in translation but honestly...  She was rude. So disgustingly rude.  No access to money for (at the least) the weekend and they just treated it as...  My fault. Unbelievably terrible experience.  Dissapointed is an understatement.Customer of 20 years,  now leaving.  Good riddance,  your company does not deserve our money; it deserves to fail.            
                Barclays bank in Dubai has proved to have unethical, inefficient, chaotic and unprofessional legal and compliance teams. The two teams are extremely unethical in their dealings with clients and have consistently tried to cover for their internal shortcomings, inefficiency and chaotic internal relationships by blaming their clients. They are untruthfull and not trustworthy teams who should be the example for ethics and high standards.The legal team and the compliance teams have major issues internally and from personal experience have tried to cover up for these issues by ruining their clients livelihoods and businesses. I would never recommend this bank nor would I trust to employ any person from these two teams in any bank. They are disgrace to Barclays and to Dubai.            
                I went to this branch in London for an address change (as they don't allow the change online like most of the other banks do), and the lady who was serving me was so full of bad attitude did not even say hi or smiled and made me feel very unwelcomed by her very very unpleasant behaviour and was rushing to send me asap. I mean you expect a certain level of customer service etiquettes from big banks and companies but it is such a shame they hire rude and unprofessional staffs to add on their notorious list of being a failing bank and the worst bank ever to deal with! There needs to be a serious rectification in the management of bank staffs' manners and ethics so they can properly represent one of the financial institutions in UK.            
                Firstly they allowed cheques, not written by me, to be presented by a person no longer associated with the account and then charged me for 3 bounced cheques. Then they tell me I have missed mortgage payments when in fact they had failed to activate the direct debit that had been set up.  I phoned them about this and they assured me that the DD was set up, stated the amount of same and that it was active.  Found out 2 months later that it still wasnt being drawn so went in to bank to sort it, finally payments were being made but, Barclays have taken no responsibility or apologised for the mistake resulting in my credit rating going down and Ihave now been refused a small loan to assist my house move. I dont owe any money but their actions have had a massive knock on effect. This final error this morning goes to demonstrate further their inability to do even the simplest tasks with any accuracy.  I should have changed banks 20 years ago when they paid a cheque for 5k into  joint account instead of the account of a similarly named account holder. When i brought it to  Barclays attention, they corrected the error and even showed me the account details of the person who should have received the money. Needless to say when a few months later the same thing happened, I phoned the other account holder and informed them of the repeated error. I'm not sure what they were more mad about, the repeated mistake or that I knew all their personal details, and how. An apology and recognition of their mistake was never received.I recently put in a complaint to Barclays Bank for repeated mistakes and poor service on my accounts. Today I get a text message with a reference number to 'track' my complaint. I go to the website specified and put in the reference number, the screen puts up an error message thats says there are insufficient digits. I check that I have entered it correctly,yes, exactly as in the text. The web page gives me a phone number to call if I should 'experience difficulties' so I call it. Call handler answers, doesn't even give a good morning or any other salutation, just says "we are unable to help with your enquiry as all our computer systems are down for an upgrade". Silence. I try to ask a question which is answered with "try again in half an hour". Silence. I hang up and wonder why the upgrades to computer systems are not done over night as they are in most other large business's. I am expecting another text with a reference number for a new complaint.  I have received a further text from Barclays saying that they have received a request from my solicitor for the redemption cost of my mortgage. This is the third I have received since 3rd October. My solicitor is still waiting for the figures and when I log in to Barclays 'track it' web page, with another reference code, it states that they received it on 5th November and I will receive a reply in 5days. Guess what I'm still waiting for, clue, its not Christmas? Tomorrow is the deadline for response to my original complaint but no doubt I will be writing another complaint. One can only assume that Barclays cannot deal with complaints efficiently because they have so many they cannot cope.            
                The worst bank ever...!!!!!!!!!!!!! They keep charging for God knows what and then ignore complaints !!!!!!!!!!!!!!            
                That is the most horrible bank I have ever been with! Don't u even think about opening account there! I have been left without my card and pin for 3 WEEKS NOW!!!gave my money and my card for boyfriend,to pay the money in (only),as I am working a lot.they locked the card,and nobody ordered new one.one week later,on my day off,had to go and ask them for new         card.yes,they did order.and send new card,with pin,and few thousand pounds in,for my previous adress!! Which has been changed 2 months ago.so another day off,another week later,they gave me new card...witout the pin.supposed to come within 3 working days.it's 5 days now.perfect banking,perfect customer service,wonderful experience! It is especially about Preston branch,but I do reccomend: don't u ever go there! This is how they treat you after being with them for 7 years! So dissapointing!            
                Worst bank ever, bad consumer service, they have no idea how to deal with customers. Had to make so many calls and branch visits but the issue is still NOT RESOLVED!            
                Had issue with fraud on Barclaycard that was dealt with really quickly. online baking really easy to use and detailed            
                For some unknown reason I was unable to use my online banking service. I called the helpline, I told them the error code which appeared to me on the screen, they said "it does not exist". After calling them a number of times, being transferred from one department to another and being disconnected 3 times... no one seemed to know what the issue was or have a clue what to do. Eventually I was given another code and I was told to bring it to my branch. They said they cannot tell me what the issue is but they put a note which would appear to the branch explaining the issue. So I went to the branch with the code, they read the issue, and I quote "I don't even have a clue what any of that means". her colleague looked at it, and nothing. They eventually called up the network department, and came back saying that the network department cannot tell them what the issue is, so no one can do anything about it. I was told to wait indefinitely until "someone calls you or sends you a letter".Now I'm in the process of closing my accounts.            
                have asked for bank statement for specified days couple of times and then received the copy of monthly statement both times. Applied for mandate change more than a months ago and still haven't heard from them , the worse service ever.            
                After over 30 years of banking with Barclays I am in the process of closing all my accounts. Barclays managed to lose £1000 of my money while transferring it between two BARCLAYS accounts. Despite numerous phone calls to their so called 'customer service' nobody would take any ownership of the problem. I had to speak to a different person every time, they seemed to think it was reasonable that the problem might not be resolved for 8 weeks (despite it being lost by them, between two of their own accounts) and nobody would provide any contact details. It was simply impossible to speak to the same person twice. When they did call me they left a message saying, 'please call Barclays Bank'. No name, no number. Whoever left the message (I never did find out because my account notes were not kept up to date) had obviously never had the distressing experience of trying to contact Barclays. I discovered today that the money was returned yesterday.  That's 3 weeks after it went missing. I have, of course, received no message from Barclays to let me know the problem had been resolved. Despite my loyalty after all these years I have finally taken the plunge and am moving all my accounts because of the unbelievably awful customer service.  There was one exception to this. I went into the branch and spoke to one of the personal bankers. He was great, said all the right things and was equally horrified by the service I had received by the bank he works for. Sadly he wasn't empowered to actually return my money but the day after I spoke to him it was returned to me - so perhaps he did have some influence somewhere. I like to think so.            
                I have had a current account with barclays since I was 15 I recently opened a student account and they didn't update my ID. This has meant that I can't get the student overdraft because my account is still 11-15. The person who was opening my account was meant to update my ID and change my current account so it's no longer 11-15. She didn't. That is not what annoyed me the most. I went to two different branches and got given two completely different things that I had to do. The inconstancy is what got me. After leaving the second branch I called to make a complaint and was put through to some person who clearly didn't understand what I was on about. I spoke to them for over an hour and I'm still no closer to knowing what's going to happen to my account and when. They said every complaint is dealt with within 8 weeks and then I can go to the FCA I hope the mess up so I can I need something done about things. This could easily be solved by using a passport but I don't have one. They have barely any alternatives because apparently everyone must have a drivers license or passport. They have my ID on their system but apparently its not good enough to update it.  I'm so confused and they really need to be dealt with.            
                I've been calling the premier banking team and am currently on hold for nearly an hour the second time tonight, disgraceful, and to think they charge £10 per month for the privelage -,what a joke            
                I moved from ING Direct to Barclays Direct in Aug 2014.  I have had numerous problems logging into my account and having a whole raft of confusing paper work, pins, cards and card readers sent to me.  I've spent hours on the phone just trying to login.  To clarify I work in IT and understand systems migrations of significant size since I've undertaken 3 of them in my career.Every call has been handled incredibly badly by the barclays off shore services team.  They never quite understand the problem and repeatedly ask "What is the purpose of you trying to login online banking" as if the fact it doesn't work is irrelevantand you need to justify why you want to check your statement.  I shouldn't need to confirm why I want to log in to be able to get assistance!!My ING mortgage account isn't showing up on my account and have spent two hours now on the phone,  with the final call handler saying its definitely there as he can see it then hanging up on me.  It must be the worst customer migration in the history of banks since I cant see details and the staff simply say "it should be there". As a heads up to Barclays, you're rubbish customer service has resulted in my transfer of ALL my savings over the weekend to tescos bank.  Once I can see my mortgage account I will be doing the same as the service you provide is absolutely below zero.Shame on you Barclays for treating its customers so badly.            
                Any.problems I have had with Barclays and Barclaycard have always immediately put right with cash payments and apologies. Very helpful customer services.            
                Since the takeover of ING by Barclays, i have not been able to view my online mortgage.... never ending phone calls later and pounds in costs and a complaint in branch... still no help from them... says problem is IT and complicated will take time to fix... been 2 months now still not able to see my mortgage at all...... Barclays just fobbing me off all the time            
                First they put image of a rat on their website, then when I explained that I have phobia for them and asked them to let me know when it is removed, so I can use they website again, they replied that they "are not aware of any site problems, in the first instance we would recommend updating Java and clearing the browser history. Alternatively try on a different internet browser to the one you are currently using"... Obviously they don't give a rat ass about they customers' concerns.            
                I used my card abroad but it said I had insufficient balance. Eventually getting through to customer service (outsourced to india) they kept telling me to use a different bank and different machine. I gave up and had to get western union transfers to get money and then 2 weeks later I found that I had £1800 taken from my account where I had been trying but didn't receive the money.Barclays have dealt with this complaint appalling. At first they forgot to log the complaints and I have asked for cctv which would prove I didn't get the money but they refuse to ask for these. It is now 18 weeks since I complained and they still have only given me part of the results of the investigation. They never ring me back and it takes at least 25 minutes to get through to them when I call.I have been with them for 25 years but have lost complete trust and will transfer all my money to a new bank this week ready for my next trip abroad.If Barclays are reading this and want to contact me then here is one of the references so you can find me - 8586-23jun14.            
                After 3 months of trying to arrange a business meeting as they don't work past 3 and not wknds , I recieved a call on the day saying business manager was ill. Another 2 months later still not heard anything back. Moved all business and personal accounts to metrobank was done in 30 mins and walked out with my new cards. Gave up after nearly 3 hours on the phone to barclays customer services just getting past from pillar to post with no clarity or solution to anything.  They didn't even have notes about my accounts,  just simply don't care. Life's to short,  move to metrobank who work on your terms and actually value you.            
                I'm an ex-ING Direct customer and was used to very good customer service, but this has all changed for the worse since my accounts were supposedly migrated to Barclays at the end of July. I can view my savings account on-line, but have not been able to access my mortgage account since July. I've spent ages on the phone to Barclays, being passed from pillar to post and no-one I've spoken to seemed to have a clue about what's going on with the ING migration. I'm just contacting them via their on-line system now as I can't afford to waste time on the phone, but they don't bother replying anymore, so I've raised a formal complaint.The official Barclays line seems to be that all ex-ING accounts, both savings and mortgage, have been successfully migrated, but that is clearly not true in my case, and I am aware of other ex-ING mortgage customers who have had similar issues. I've been involved with a number of system migrations in the past 30 years and the process should be straightforward if the analysis is done properly before the migration starts and thorough testing is done during and after the migration. In the case of the ING migration, someone has clearly screwed up and heads should be rolling down the corridors of "Barclays Towers" as there appears to have been a systemic failure in several phases of the project lifecycle, from requirements definition, analysis, all the way to acceptance testing. I also felt that I'd been bombarded with letters from Barclays prior to the alleged transfer, which I found very confusing - why couldn't they just summarise what was supposed to happen rather than fire off a missive every time the wind direction changed (or so it seemed...). A classic case of a company not putting themselves in their customers' "shoes" and thinking about how the letters would be perceived by the end user. If the ex-ING mortgage rate wasn't so good I'd leave Barclays like a shot, but feel trapped in a bad situation.Overall, it's been a pretty abysmal performance from Barclays to date.            
                When we opened up our business account it all seemed very promising, then problems began, starting with the company secretary getting married and needing to change the surname details on the account, which we tried to do several times, but the name still hadn't been changed when we closed the account to go elsewhere. Trying to get finance for new projects was a joke, we had a great credit rating and good profit margins, but could we get a loan? Yeah from everywhere except Barclays, our business contact at the bank looked like he'd only just got out of nappies and often acted as such, my advice would be to avoid this bank at all costs.            
                having used Barclays as a business bank it took us 3 months to open the first account, we were insulted by staff at the Crouch End office, the online banking tool does not work 75% of the time, Pinsentry is the worst system - the machine works with 4 (1) flat batteries and when they run out you have to do 5 working days without banking while they order a replacement, making a payment by telephone banking takes half a day, staff all across the company are rude and unhelpful. despite being a global bank, Barclays has the worst currency account service. Avoid this bank at all costs            
                Despite being a Premier Life customer, a continual stream of screw ups took me away and over to the joys of First Direct... Vote with your feet!            
                I had not realised how poor Barclays service has become until I tried to transfer an amount via online banking using pin-sentry with authentication card. For some reason the pin locked and I was instructed to contact the bank, which I did via telephone. Virgin landline call charges are not the cheapest and I waited for about 15 mins to receive an answer from an Indian call-centre. The lady informed me that I could clear the locked pin via any ATM. I promptly drove to an ATM machine and attempted to clear the pin to no avail. I drove home and telephoned the same number as before and again after about 15 mins the call was answered by an Indian male operator who informed me that only a Barclays ATM would work. Had I known this, I could have driven further in the first instance, to a Barcley's ATM. I was livid and lodged a complaint via the operator who stated that this would be a level 1 complaint. I asked to raise the level  to 2 so that I could speak to an operator in the UK and was asked to hold for a short while. After another approx 15 mins the Indian operator returned to apologise for the delay at which I launched a tirade of abuse concerning Barclay's service and hung up. I don't know how many complaint levels Barclay's customer-service utilise but I would suggest a very large number, so that they can spread the obvious huge total very thinly.So called online banking is a joke when a problem cannot be solved online. I cleared all the sensitive required information online and via telephone and yet I still now have to journey to a Barclay's branch to stick a card into a machine (assuming this will actually give me the option of unlocking the pin). Once reactivated I will enjoy transferring any residual balances into one of my other accounts with  either Virgin or Halifax. It seems that after 50 years Barclays are really no further on than the old passbook and cheque- book days for convenience, with the added burden of appalling customer dissatisfaction.Mike(Stockport area)            
                My Ing account was transferred to Barclyas and I have been trying to speak to them about the authorisation card they should have sent me... Trying to speak to them on the phone is a trail and a half - ages and ages on hold and they only advertise the premium rate number.Complete incompetence when you finally do talk to someone and they keep needing to transfer you to a specialised department - which means 10 minutes + on hold again! Even the Complaints Department "is experiencing an unusual number of calls" and takes more than 10 minutes - I hung up and started typing!!! They also used exactly the same lie to explain the delay on two separate calls - "my colleague was experiencing trouble with his computer" - even if it had been true, they clearly don't have enough "colleagues" because Barclays in interested only in costs not customer satisfaction - they don't seem to realise that the latter is the route to profit! However, honest profit is not what these guys want - nothing but excess will do -and we should not let them extract money from us.These people do not deserve to be in business, we should all take our money away and they would shrivel and die! I have had my current account with First Direct for years and have nothing but praise for them. As soon as i can access my account the money is moving!            
                From our switch over to Barclays at the end of April 2014 until present (Aug 2014), the service provided has been utterly useless.  We've lost count of the amount of times they've created problems (e.g. taking my husband's name off the joint account for no apparent reason); not been able to follow through with simple banking tasks; and overall, been totally unhelpful with our requests.  We are now changing banks after only 4 months with Barclays.  It has taken unnecessary time, energy and a lot of stress on behalf of myself and my husband using Barclays for such a short period of time.  I would discourage anyone from using this bank.            
                I've been trying to get through to the Barclays call centre to obtain a new passcode - it is virtually impossible to speak to a real person.  I actually did manage to get through once and then was cut off (deliberately in my opinion, because they couldn't be arsed to sort out my query).I will now have to go to an actual branch but no doubt they will be just as unhelpful - and in these modern times, I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT!I didn't even ask to have an account with Barclays - my ING account got transferred to Barclays.  I'm going to close it down and go elsewhere!            
                Barclays are dreadful. Really dreadfulThey recently made me a Premier customer - which was nice of themThen they messed up a simple cash ISA transfer....Twice....After 10 calls to the call centre I went into a branch to talk to my "personal adviser"TwiceThe first time I was told I'd have to wait for 40 minutesThe second time an hourIf that's Premier Banking then how bad must it be normally !!!!First Direct here I come            
                I have been a long term Barclays customer. Just tried to sort out a fraud issue (there wasn't one) but they were worried there was.. Got through to an Indian call centre, they took my card number down wrongly on 2 occasions. Could not find any transactions for the authorisation checks even though I was reading them from online banking, live in front of me. Really poor service. Im sure I wouldn't do particularly well in an Indian call centre fielding calls from Indian citizens. Point is that the whole experience was very frustrating. Not the first time either.Tried another number and been on hold for 30 mins, just put the phone down.I have considered changing banks and now I will...            
                We took our mortgage on our first property with Barclays (Woolwich) as they offered us the highest lending amount. We have regretted it ever since.A string of errors and incompetence left our house purchase at risk of falling through. During this time they even managed to get the address of the property we were buying wrong! We only found out after daily phone calls for weeks to chase progress. Finally we were told the valuation was booked so called the surveyors-to be told the address they had was different to the property we were buying. This combined with zero communication from Barclays (we had to chase them almost daily to find out they needed further documents etc) left us lodging a formal complaint.Our complaint again required us to chase them. Eventually we got a letter in early June saying they would give us compensation for their poor service. We have yet to receive this compensation (2 months later) and are now on hold for over 50 minutes to chase this. They also held incorrect details on the mortgage account that was setup-wrong date of birth, contact numbers and postal addresses. Ordered debit card in branch-chase 2 weeks later and there's no record of them being ordered.Absolutely diabolical processes and systems. The average time per phone call has been 45mins (30mins of which is spent on hold).We will never use Barclays again and will make sure friends and family do the same.They are in the customer service business and yet they do not seem to have any comprehension of what that means. I only wish we had seen the reviews on this site before proceeding.            
                Barclays have been bad over the years, but they have got so much worse lately. They have no idea what they are walking about, are arrogant and lie. They have had a lot of 'down time' recently, and when I queried why their online banking was down recently they told me it wasn't. Long story short - it was. I was on the phone for over 40 minutes trying to explain that it wasn't working, when finally I was told that despite the fact that all forums and the Barclays downtime calculator were showing the system down, it was my computer that had a problem. I have three computers, I have four browsers, all were affected, it wasn't me, it was them. They refused to take responsibility and told me to update my computers. Totally rubbish. I spoke to four different departments and ended up with the complaints department who assured me it was my fault. These guys need to be investigated - and I hope something nasty is found that sees them barred from operating.            
                I have only had one grievance with my bank in 30 years regarding mis-selling. The matter was dealt with promptly and compensation exceeded expectations.            
                I rely on monthly bank statements to chase credit apart from knowing how much is in my account. I was changed from monthly statements to quarterlies, without even the courtesy of being informed.Saving money to fund premier league sponsorship no doubt, but it won't be on money any more. Account being closed.            
                The deplorable manner of this company is truly shocking! We have recently had to raise a formal complaint following the completely unsympathetic and callous attitude of their staff.We have been trying to apply for a mortgage recently as a first time buyer, we approached Barclays for a mortgage as we had entrusted them with inherited savings following a bereavement. We have hoped to use the funds to help secure our purchase only to find that the pathetic service we had received and gross mis-selling of their products had locked out funds in savings bonds completely against what we had been advised. We had finally been encouraged after we raised a complaint and had encountered the first competent member of staff that actually seemed to be helpful, only for the complaint to be seemingly ignored. We had requested, quite reasonably that we received full written confirmation of our complaint and transcripts of the calls as confirmed by the agent on the phone. To date the only signs of progress in this complaint are a text advising they will be in contact with us "shortly" that is now 6 days old! If that's their definition of shortly I dread to think what a lengthy delay would be.Currently we are still waiting to hear from the Bank and at this rate we will never get to buy the dream house that we can clearly afford all due the banks incompetence. I feel sorry for anyone who is still dealing with this cold and heartless organisation. Shame I can't give them no stars as one star seems far too generous at the moment.            
                To talk to the bank is next to impossible! My husband has been on hold for an hour and still holding!!!!!!            
                My daughter is travelling in the US. Her ipod was stolen so went to buy a new one but the transaction was decline. At home in the Uk we get an automated call from Barclays saying she MUST call them. We check with Barclays -she MUST call them. So she calls but is put on hole for so long that she runs out of call credit. Calls again. On hold for another 25 minutes but the man on the end of the phone can't hear her clearly so hangs up. Calls again. Put on hold for another 30 minutes only to be told there is nothing wrong with her card. Total phone bill £120. Unbelievable. Disgraceful.            
                Worst customer service with the highest overdraft fees. It’s better to get a payday loan than using the Barclays overdraft. Changing to Natwest today!!!            
                We made an error making an online payment by inadvertently hitting the confirm button, within 30 seconds of realising the error, we phoned Barclays and asked them to stop the transaction and put the money back into our account.  Their comment was the money was already in the recipients account and they had no systems in place to recover the money.  It is amazing that when they are owed money they can take it out of anyone's account when they feel like it!!.    Are we the only one in the world to have ever made such an error?    So much for Barclays!! Incompetence or unwillingness to help? - they are both as bad as each other.            
                Don't anyone bank with barclays not only they are the worst bank in England they have surpended mine and my 81 year old nan account on top of that they have put a loan into her account of £7500  witch she didn't want they are accusing me and my nan for doing this loan            
                Barclays are the worse bank ever with awful customer service. I opened an account with Barclays in store with a deposit of over 500. I had all my letters come through, card, pin and Internet details, and pin for Internet banking. When I opened the pin for Internet banking it ripped so I couldn't see the number. I phoned the 0845 number and the customer service staff are so rude! They only asked me 4 questions which was full name, address, account number and date of birth. The lady said please hold, and came back about 5 mins later saying I have failed to pass security clearing and had my account blocked!!! She never said what or why I failed, but I couldn't use any ATM or online banking to get access to my cash. After the weekend I went in to branch and saw the branch manager who looked like she couldn't give a damn and I withdrew all my deposit. Please guys stay well away from Barclays!! You have been warned :-)            
                3 days to make a transfer from my Barclays account to my other bank - Their phone banking 0845 number always get you back to a call center in India where a very nice chap keep asking you if you had a good day - the answer is no - my money is still not transfered - you try to call back the fraud line number to ask information about your money - no one bothers to pick up the phone - You try to call to complain - a lady with an icy  voice tells you .......to call that  very same number again -Kafka would not have done any better I will switch to Santander            
                I am surprised to hear so much negativity on here, I have genuinely never been so impressed with a bank before.I use Barclays for my personal and business accounts and find their service spot on, the local branch staff are friendly and the branch manager really does work hard to help when needed.            
                My adult son has learning difficulties and autism and when I got through to the Indian call centre and explained that I would be speaking on his behalf once he had cleared security. The advisor was very rude about my son and told me haughtily that any prompting him to clear security that he would terminate the call. He did EXACTLY that. My son was trying hard to listen to someone ask security questions where English is not their first language. When my son struggled to answer a particularly difficult question, the operator hung up on him. My son was very upset and thought he had done something wrong. To say I am livid is an understatement. I am in the process of making a formal complaint. Dreadful company that uses Indian call centres which causes frustration and misunderstanding on both sides. I've happily moved banks to the CO OP I've never had an advisor who's first language is not English and this is much easier to aid communications for my son and myself. Just to add, Barclays  charges for overdrafts are an absolute outrage. There is a petition people can sign on the internet to log your displeasure of these charges. I can't remember who started it or how to sign it but I'm sure if you google it, you will find it. I happily signed it.            
                I apologise I'm going to charge you £3.00 a day...I apologise, apologise, apologise.........I don't want apologies I want action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A truly terrible bank!!!            
                Very satisfied !            
                My church needed to change the Bank Mandate for our Parish Magazine account when our former Treasurer resigned and the Vicar left the Parish about the same time.  The new Mandate form and personal ID forms were completed by the new Treasurer and signatories and posted, but then the Mandate form was returned with a pecular note stating that the two people to be removed from the Mandate (the former Treasurer and Vicar) have other accounts with Barclays, and would we like to remove them from those accounts too.  (These other accounts were presumably their personal accounts which have nothing to do with the church).            
                terrible terrible service, I have cleared funds, verified payee but not able to withdraw due to "security reasons" one hour and half later, feel like i have been passed round india to no avail.  Will be going into branch tomorrow, withdrawing MY money and closing account. Worst customer service ever. AVOID AT ALL COSTS            
                1) internet banking - one dept2) Use of Apps - one dept3) Telephone banking - one dept4) Branch banking - one dept. Book an appointment in advance, but don't expect any human service!  Four key touch-points and absolutely nothing is joined-up! Barclays get real - you may think you are providing a service having all the gimmicks - but go back to the text book - customer service is key. Big MISTAKE transferring my account to Barclays Bank.....            
                Failed to resolve my query re a mortgage application            
                Great service, very happy with my mortgage application and customer service.            
                Just called to enquire about my overdraft. It was like talking to a robot - he really didn't understand what I was asking and then cut me off! It's probably not his fault as English is not his first language but he kept saying the same thing over and over again and clearly didn't  understand my questions. I can't be bothered going through it all again  and will try again tomorrow in core hours.            
                will go down to the branch then close my account, as this is an absolute joke of a bank. i'm very angry and frustrated.... try and get your money is like mission impossible. Will be going with Lloyd much more customer friendly professional better all round experience.            
                I have been denied access to my personal and two business accounts because they are reviewing my personal account. 4 days of many long phone calls and visits to the branch manager (who was shocked that they had done this to my account but couldn't do anything about it) and still no reasons or explanation other than you have to wait until we have finished investigating and we will write to you once we are done. They even had the nerve to tell me not contact them again! I cannot access any of my money and all DD have been stopped. Disrespectful and disgraceful treatment and what makes it worse is iv been banking  with them for over 20years with no problems.            
                I recently went into my local Barclays branch to set up an under 18's account. From what I saw I may of had to book an appointment and then this pleasant man offered to open it up. He was very polite and someone who I felt who I could have a laugh with (well I did anyway). Alongside him he had an assistant in training who was just as nice and I dare say she will succeed in the future. Over the phone they are extremely helpful and there telephone, mobile and internet services are very easy to use and a nice easy to use layout. Great service from a great bank.            
                my account has been suspended buy Barclays sayng that is under review for nearly 3 days I have no money in my pocket ,I have plans to go on holiday for this easter bought the tickets to travel and now cant go anymore,i have tried to communicate whit the branch called the fraud department but the only answer I got is that I have to wait until they will make a decision regarding my account ,no explanation what so ever why ,they don't even care that they left me whit no money for this easter not even when I explain to them that I have ticket to go on holiday which has been planned 2 weeks ago .CAN ANYONE HELP ME WHIT THIS?            
                I have a priceline visa through barclays.  The only reason I got it was to get $50 off a plane ticket.  EVERY time I go to log into the account to make a payment it says my password is incorrect....EVERY time!  I have NEVER had this problem with any other financial institution before.As soon as I pay off this card I will cancel it and I'll NEVER have anything to do with this company again!            
                Its an frustrating and worst bank ever.They hqve cancelled my accounts without any prior info and without any reason. And they stopped my internet banking too and telling that the reason is comfidential. What the bullshit bank is! Now i ask to return my whole amount which i dont know how much as they stopped my access to account, they are telling not having the balance at the time. Worst experience ever.            
                We switched from HSBC to Barclays some 9 months ago and so far they have been excellent. HSBC were like a bunch of part time amateurs whereas Barclays have been very professional, helpful and friendly. Our business manager is excellent.            
                Their charges are absolutely disgusting!!!! ALL SMALL business should avoid like the plague!!! There's absolutely no gain from using the business account and they charge you well over the top for everything. Use a personal account instead and don't let them bully you into believing you have to use a business account!            
                I've held a fixed rate mortgage for 7 yrs and to date have that much conflictinting information, they even told the FOS wrong information. In 2012 I paid a 5% lump sum off my mortgage, they then calculated my annual statement wrong. The FOS awarded me a sum for their incompetence. In 2013 I paid a 5% lump and again they have calculated my mortgage wrong, this again has been referred to the FOS. Every time that a complaint is registered it costs the bank circa £500. So complain. They will not forward me a copy of the terms and conditions relating to my mortgage nor will they produce the calculation showing how my revised figure has been calculated. I will get this information via the FOS.Up date FOS has taken up the case, barclays told FOS case closed. Barclays had to open a new case, offered £100 compensation for getting it wrong but have not released terms and conditions or a reconciliation of my mortgage. They have also reduced my monthly payments, in the last 3 weeks I've been given 4 different figures all of which are wrong.This in tern means I'm being denied the right to over pay my mortgage set out by Barclays. My next step is to take this to the small claims court. ARE YOUR PAYMENTS CORRECT ???            
                It only took 15 calendar days from applying for mortgage to official offer!!! And there was 4 wasted days from my wife's employer, by not supplying some documents.So very happy!!! Also super nice to receive text messages on phone for any updates.Only down side was that mortgage advisor is very pushy with selling life insurance as well, makes me feel like bonus or period target more than a human customer.But overall 5 stars.I would recommend them to anyone, they were the cheapest as well.If you do not meet their criteria it is more like your fault than theirs, I guess.            
                I took out a 2 yr fixed mortgage and change of circumstances mean that I need to move 3 months early. I am being charged an £8000 early repayment fee. All staff say is that it was in the small print when I took out the mortgage. No one will tell me how much profit Barclays are making on this. 'I FEEL ROBBED'. Most other banks reduce the fee over time - I will go to them in future!            
                Been banking with them for nearly 14 years and am happy with my personal account service. Special shout out to Barclays in Worcester PArk. So helpful and nice!            
                Getting competent staff on the phone is game of russian roullete: a) one call, and you  get an excellent operative who deals with your query expertly and to the point. b) you call, and get a sequence of transfers to their obscure departments, while you initially dialed the number on their correspondence, which was supposed to deal with your issue.Unfortunately, you are more likely to get a a lot of the latter, as Barclays seems to be adept at hiring brainless idiots and training them how to transfer calls between endless departments.            
                The business help line arranged for the account manager to call me at 14:30, they never called. When I phoned then they promised to contact me within three hours, again nobody called. This happened two further times. They finally called me at gone 15:00 the day after they had originally promised; just over 24 hours late. Thus, I wasted a day and a half waiting for them to call, during which time I made five phone calls to them and had to explain the story each time - they obviously cannot be bothered to record the details of the concern. They are do not seem capable of providing a service to a small business.            
                We tried to withdraw 100 pounds from an ATM at Stansted Airport. We got a receipt - but no money. And 2 weeks later no answer from Barclays.            
                Just came back from Barclays branch in Harborne Birmingham! What a disgrace. The worst customer service I ever had both from the staff and the “Manager” . On the 8th of Nov I paid into my account £700 at the cashier desk. At the end of the month I have received my statement and that money weren’t in. So luckily I kept my receipt and I when back today to ask the bank where the money were. The Miss X which was serving me presented herself as the Manager and after looking up onto the system said that the money were deferred. When I asked how is possible this to happen as I remember she was the same cashier I paid the money with, she said she doesn’t know. So my response was “How can you tell me you don’t know why you didn’t pay the money correctly into my account? What about if I didn’t keep the receipt? There wasn’t any way on Earth I could proof I paid those money in. “She then responded very rudely and started defending herself instead of apologise! So she didn’t apologise and I said to her I want to close my account immediately and would like the details of her Manager. She said to me to take a seat and wait for the adviser as she couldn’t close the account for me (?). I then sat and waited and saw with my own eyes the adviser was walking around the branch and getting ready to go home. I went back to Miss X and asked why is she coming back to me but instead made me wait for half an hour. She said the adviser was with another customer lying straight into my eyes. When I asked for the Manager Miss X said the he “went to collect his children and should be back soon”. On a Friday afternoon – the bank full of people THE MANAGER WENT TO COLLECT HIS CHILDREN! Amazing!Furthermore, when he arrived, he was even ruder than her. He told me he apologise for the wait but he had another appointment (!) . I then told him that I know where he was and there was no need to lie to me as well. I started explaining what have happened but he didn’t want to know as he was already upset that I questioned his absence. I did mention that once the “customer had right” in the conversation and he replayed “Well time has changed”. At the end he closed my account and I asked wouldn’t he at least apologise for the mistake they made and he said “NO I DON’T THINK I HAVE TO APPOLOGISE TO YOU”So in total: No apology for the mistake they made, rude staff at the desk, and EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE MANAGER WHO DIDN’T BOTHER STOPPING ME CLOSING SAVINGS ACCOUNT WITH A LOT OF MONEY IN AND DIDN’T CARE OF LOOSING A LOYAL CUSTOMER OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS!            
                I transferred 500usd from my Singapore bank to a UK SEO company on 18th of October. Unfortunately, their bank is Barclays. After 4 working days, they called me back and asked me what's the purpose of the transfer because I mentioned "Yangon" as the website we were working on is about Yangon Guide. And they asked strange questions like if there is any connection with Iran. I mean really? How is that Yangon has anything to do with Iran. They couldn't be more ignorant. On 25th, my bank DBS confirmed me that the funds has been released. So I checked with the SEO company, they informed me they haven't received the payment. So I called my bank they informed me to check with beneficiary bank. So I called Barclays, they informed me to lunch an investigation via my bank as they cannot provide me any info. So I have been kept calling to my bank everyday since then, I do not know where my money went. 2 weeks is a serious financial damage. Nobody seems to be accountable for this incident. It is unbelievable. I think I will share this story on my page which has 80000 likes since I cannot be bother to sue them.            
                I have banked with few banks including world most known, however no other bank could ever meet my satisfactions as Barclays always does! Whatever I need, whatever I want, I can always get it sorted on the day with a bank with no hassle! Also is great to know when I call the bank over the phone I get to speak with an ENGLISH speaking person, rather than a foreigner whom I cannot understand! Enough Said, in my opinion Barclays scores 10 out of 10 for me!            
                After spending 1hour to read, answer, and fill in the application to open an on-line CD, I was rejected and told to call.  They said they wanted me to fax my DL, SS Card, and Utility bill for their review and that they were going to keep the application for seven years on file.  I said I did not have a fax machine or desire to send all this new information previously undisclosed and requested that they just delete my application.  She said no and I then spoke to a supervisor.  He said it was the Patriot Act that made them keep my account numbers and SS # even though we had done no business.  I am hard put to understand why they think that I (international threat) would want to deposit my money in there bank just to get even with them and the US.  I will probably need my money to pay my fine to Obama Care (Affordable Care Act).            
                I applied for a basic account, was told to send some IDS (copy's) bank statement, driver licence etc etc, filled in the form with my signature and posted the items 3 weeks ago, heard nothing as of yet, walked in to a Birmingham branch and a rude assistant wouldn't help me with any updates, she said you will receive a letter, she didn't even ask my name etcthen I phoned the customer service number, OMG I was passed to around to 5 agents and finally some Asian guy told me he cant find me on the systems at all, and no record of and post from me (this is a pre paid envelope Barclays give you),every number I dial, ends up in a dead end, Barclays have gone down the pan, so so so bad, and now I have some lost IDS thanks for nothing barclays            
                This is the worst bank I ever dealt with. I applied for many credit cards from other banks and I never had hard time like I did with Barclays. I have an excellent credit score (780). After my application, I got a phone call from them saying that every thing looks good but they still have to verify my identity. Asked a couple of questions then asked to mail a copy of my driver license, social security card and a utility bill. I sent all of the documents, and It has been more than 2 weeks now and they still say they never received them. Customer service is terrible. No way to talk to any manager. Also they do a hard inquiry  on your credit (which makes you loose a couple of points) without telling you..            
                Made an appointment in a local Barclay's branch which was extremely easy. Had my appointment today to open an account and the adviser was nothing but helpful and did not at all make me feel rushed, infact it was like talking to somebody i had known for years. She helped me set up all my mobile banking apps and she couldn't of possibly done more for me, went well above and beyond her call of duty! I certainly know the difference between good and bad customer service with banks after been a very dissatisfied customer with HSBC. I was so happy with the service i have received i have been recommending this to family and friends. I would certainly love my feedback been passed on. Extremely happy i now have a bank that seems to care!            
                I recently went to close an ISA which i hadn't used for a while in order to open a new one with a better interest rate with a different Bank. The personal banking person talked me out of it and showed me that I would have a really good interest rate on my savings if I were to move them into it so I did. within a month of adding my savings to the account I had a letter saying they were going to be reducing my interest by 1% effectively making my ISA worse than everywhere else. so I have basically been stitched up. Now that I have added to this ISA I cannot open another until april.I have been with since 2000 and have slowly become less pleased with the service and products they offer. All of there products seem to be more expensive than other banks and they do not value the long term customers. they are basically a bunch on con men just looking to make money out of you. I will be slowly moving all my accounts to a different bank, wouldn't recommend anyone to open a new account when there are so many better banks offering better deals            
                I've been applying for the Career Development Loan with Barclays so I can start my masters at the University of Manchester in September. You can't apply for the loan until 8 weeks before the course start date which is stressful in itself but after having applied things only got more stressful. I sent away the application internally through Barclays which the branch ensured me would be quicker and more secure, the people at the branch were very lovely and helpful. However, when I rang to enquire about the progress of the application the service I received on the phone was very abrupt. I rang again at a later date to see if there was any further progress and was told that my application had been denied on the basis of a single 'returned item fee', however, this returned item fee was due to a third party error - I mentioned this on the phone and was told I could appeal within a month and reapply in 3 months. Of course reapplying is not an option given that the start of the course is in September (and it's not like I could have applied earlier given that you're not allowed to do so) so my only choice is to appeal. When I asked how to appeal the advisor wasn't very helpful, just repeating that I could appeal within a month and reapply in 3 months, at this point I was very upset and in shock since I don't have any debts, I've always stayed within my allowed overdraft (which was necessary since I'm doing a masters degree currently and needed to pay for rent and living expenses on my own as I can't get benefits as a student) and the single problem was due to an error that wasn't my fault, at this point I just said goodbye and hung up the phone. I had to call back to try and get someone to tell me exactly what I needed to do to appeal, I wanted to do it as quickly as possible as I didn't want someone else's error to affect my entire future. I eventually managed to get someone to explain explicitly what I needed which required a great deal of coaxing (as no one had explained the first time around) and organised it all within a day and it was sent off again internally (again the staff in branch were really great and helpful), I rang to ask whether the appeal had been received and what the process was for looking at appeals and was told that they hadn't received it and that someone would call me with the a decision, they didn't tell me how long it would take or what the process was. I'm so stressed about it all and so angry that it was rejected on this basis as I've spoken to other people who have been maxed out on their credit card and overdraft and still received the loan. My brother used to work in a bank and he told me that they often operate tiers of quotas, finding any reason to reject some within a certain tier - I sincerely hope that I haven't been put through this for the sake of quotas. I'm trying to complete my dissertation, find accommodation  and prepare for a course I'm not even sure I can do and sort out this loan. I'm so worried and upset that every time I've spoken to Barclays I've been made to feel like I'm inconveniencing them by calling, but this is my entire future. Why is there such a discrepancy between the service received in branch and the service over the phone?            
                I never thought this would happen. as you can see I bank with barcalys and it dont seem to be a very good bank to bank with. I have been missing money from my account a few times before and everytime I complain barclays never sort it out. I have wrote to them about 2 months ago and they have not replyed back yet.  Well last month they suspended my account so I couldn't do anything with it, take money out, put money in , or even pay my bills. I had to wait 2 weeks to get hold of my money after making loads of phone calls and having to go through security and waiting ages on the phone and dealing with rude people on the phone. Just 2 weeks ago now they decided to suspend my account again I called customer services again they had put me tthrough to the right department that deals with these things. I asked them why is my card suspended again and told me to read my terms and conditions, because they can suspend people accounts whenever they want to and they dont even have to tell me why. Well ok so now I need money I asked if I could get some cash out they told me I had to go to the counter and I will be able to get cash out. Well I got there showed my id and everythin and now the people at the branch are telling me that I cant take any cash out because my account is suspended I nicely explained to them that the people on the phone sayd if I wanted some cash I could get it at the counter. They still not wanted to give me cash then they were saying that I needed proof of address but i still cudnt take money out my own account. Lol. Well but its not funny at all. I have a baby at home she just turned 1 I had no food electricity or gas in the house I make my shopping weekly.  I explained all this to the branch manager in tears and all he did was say he understands my situation but still  I couldnt get any cash out. I dont have any family living near me to help How could this be right it is my account. After this is all finishd I will close my account with them. I do not recommend barclays to no one. They put you in situations you should never have to go through.            
                I work as an accountant and 'used' to love the Barclays Brand. Last year I got a package premiere account and paid £17.50 per month. The sales pitch was it would be useful for me and there would be benefits .. so I signed up. eg insurance, breakdown cover, airport lounges, However it dawned on me that my household insurance would cover for items (which by the way was with Barclays) , my company car breakdown covered my my employer, etc etc. So i stopped the account for premiere. I asked for an explanation to why I was sold the product given the points above . The reply I got was that I signed the customer contract and entered an agreement. I tried to ring to speak to the writer of the letter and was told very curtly - that "we have made it clear we have closed the matter in our file and the writer of the letter is unavailable' . So in short - get lost!In the past I used to recommend Barclays to clients.. but this stopped. Part of my frustration is the money but more the treatment to value me as a customer. Step by step I will move my various products to other companies. They are just rude and don't listen.            
                I recently got married and had to change my details with Barclays, I have been with them for 8 year and never had a problem until now, I went into a branch with my marriage certificate and all other documents I needed to do the name change. All went well and they did the name change with no problem. I then get home and now have to phone to change my details on my online banking and mobile banking, the lady that I spoke to for the online banking changed everything for me and was quite pleasant, she then transferred me to the mobile banking call center, what a rude woman I spoke to, she could nearly speak english, but I then discovered that the woman in branch has spelt my surname wrong ( even though the spelling was right in front of her). Whilst on the phone to mobile banking the advisor was getting extremely rude, and then proceeded to hang up on me, I tried to call back to speak to management, but was transferred from one advisor to another. Due to all of this I then had to return to the branch to change my name all over again, then call online banking again, and doing all this at 8 months pregnant. I am dreading having to change my address incase your staff mess that one up too. I am now looking at changing banks as I can't be bothered with a bank that treats its customers like dirt they have scraped under their shoe. I suggest you get your staff sorted before you loose all your customers. Oh and sort out your charges, they are ridiculous.            
                The worst bank. Avoid it. Unqualified members of staff, they do not know themselves what they are doing. Charge me monthly for nothing. Closed my account without informing me of upgrades, still waiting for a new card to be dispatched (5 days) left me without money and explanation.Spent ridiculous amount of money on Call Center, for what? To speak to a bunch of unqualified people who were putting me on hold and transferring me between each other. AVOID AVOID AVOID.            
                I will STRONGLY advise about anybody thinking of taking or using Barclay's Mortgage Care.. if you ever need it..(and God forbid), Barclay's will jump through every hoop they can find to AVOID paying you.. We all have this type if insurance hoping never to need it. but if you ever do, the last thing you need is a major battle on your hands to rightfully claim what you have been paying premiums for years for.Even as a customer of 40 years does not seem to count as any form of loyalty. Barclays seemed quite happy for us to risk losing our house just to avoid paying what was due....Gary CruiseAn update to our situation from #6 above. The Financial Ombudsmanicon has made their decision and come down in our favour. Informing Barclaysicon that they should compensate my wife something in the order of over £5'000. after 8 to 10 weeks, we finally received a cheque for £200.. Thinking that this was the end of the matter.. after getting the Ombudsman to investigate again, we then received another cheque for £1'200. Barclays are again being totally unreasonable and UNBELIEVABLE!!!!            
                I have been with Barclays since 1982 and have had very good customer service with them.on the 3 occssions I got myself in trouble with unscrupulous websites Barclays staff helped me fill in the appropriate forms and after the legal requirement for them to allow the websites to respond on each occasion the money was put back into my account.they have also been helpful on several other occasions when I needed a loan or assistance.I only stopped short of given them 5 stars because of their mortgage facilities which were with the Woolwich which did not offer the slightest discount for a long time Barclays customer which I thought they should.But overall I am very happy to stay with Barclays and definitely recommend them.john tandy            
                The customer service is disgraceful.  Just all together awful and I intend to close my bank account with them immediately.            
                I am one of those people who switch their accounts between bank to maximise deals.Firstly I would say I have banked or had an account with all the major high street banks in my years.1. Change barclays overseas customers service telephone line back to the uk.  The advisors cannot converse with their customers and sometimes you are left wondering why you have bothered telephoning the bank in the first place. I would say If you have watched The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel a scene from the movie is where she teaches the call centre on how to deal with customers as human beings.2. Great customer service in branches I have found.One advisor called anne at st anne square manchester delivers excellent customer service each time I see her. 3.  I haven't yet had any issues with the product or charges. So I cannot comment.  From reading the terms and conditions they seem fair.            
                After going over my overdraft by £4.43 Barclay's find it acceptable to charge me £40! I work hard for my money every month and struggle to make ends meet! But Barclay's never cease to amaze me with their compassion! *sarcastic* They sit on my money collecting interest on a monthly basis and still charge me for the privilege! To top it off my account costs me £7 a month, that's £84 a year for nothing! Do not join Barclay's as they will take your money and charge you when ever it suits!            
                Please avoid by all means. Charges are ridiculous and they don't help their customers at all!!  They passed me from pillar to post. Please don't take their Premier Account.Ms S.            
                In February we applied for a mortgage fom Woolwich, brand of Barclays. It was agreed in principle – then suddenly declined. Apart from the grounds being spurious, they took a £150 "withdrawal fee", even though we certainly did not withdraw. Bordering on fraud, yet it took repeated demands to get that refunded. The mortgage lot didn't even bother contacting me. My demands for an additional payment (to charity) for all the distress and time lost have been ignored. My strong impression is that they regard customers with contempt. There will be consequences, including this review and closing our Barclays premium account.            
                Due to numerous annoying problems I closed all my accounts with Barclays.On closing the accounts I asked for closing statements to be sent that was back in January 2013. Never received them.I now urgently need them as 3 were trust accounts and I need to prepare accounts for the trusts which I cannot do without the bank statements.I have phone every week for the past 3 weeks asking for the statements been assured everytime they would be sent.Guess what no statements and now the 25th April.Absolutely appalling service            
                If you've got a query, head to your branch or call them directly. Calling customer services is like entering a labyrinth - you never know where each 'I'll transfer you to a colleague' will take you. Tried emailing for a general query as I was overseas and knew it would eat up my money and time to call (if the information - on international transfer charges - is on the website, it's really well hidden). What followed would have been funny if I hadn't been looking for a relatively fast response.The first email was an irrelevant template. There's no dedicated advisor so your reply goes right back into the general system. The second email was an acknowledgement of my complaint and a reassurance that they were taking my concerns very seriously (I didn't complain!) and still no information on the topic I was asking about. They also said that they would have to investigate this and respond in writing - a waste of manpower and paper for a complaint that does not exist. The third email was the same template that I received in Email 1.In the end, I jumped on the phone to the number they suggested and after three different advisors in two departments, two of which couldn't say for sure what the answer was and gave me different numbers, I think I got the information I was looking for.Sigh. First Direct could teach you a think or two (or ten).Edited to add, complaints procedure handled very efficiently, which is great, but doesn't solve the problems at the beginning of the customer service experience. I would still warn people away from Barclays until customer service has been improved.            
                I wanted to link an account to our offset mortgage. This was no problem in branch (very helpful).By phone..... well 1st call enter a lot of details to the automated system, wait 15 minutes for an "agent" then repeat the same info only to be told you need to transfer to the offset team. This was one of the first questions asked in order to put me in touch with the right team!The offset team were busy so this was actioned by the handler for completion within 5 working days. Two weeks later its still not done so.... second call repeat of first except 17 minutes this time for the same result.Third time lucky?? Wait and see            
                Stuck in Sweden for 7 days with a useless connect card, no money for food, will eat card soon I fear. Customer support is a joke, spent over £100 in phone calls and still no money. They will send me a new card... in England, it'll be there when I return from Sweden, will bin it I think and change to a different bank if I haven't starved to death in the mean time. Would give no stars if it were an option. Only been a customer for 29 years so I'm obviously not that important.            
                My experience of Barclays is very mixed, as a business user i have  lot of dealings with Barclays. If i have a problem and i have to use the call centres then i find them extremely poor. I never have any issues when dealing with my branch or any branch managers. Barclays business managers seem to be lacking any real knowledge of the business world and it's hard work dealing with them especially the ones who seem to have just left education.            
                Barclay work hard to remove any human interaction with their customers. Managers now have no authority to overide the computor credit assesments even whenthose assements are demostrably wrong. Premier customers now treated like all others..... a huge change to the original offering.How difficult would it be to offer the original Premier Service at a higher cost? Survey your Premier Customers and see what they say. I for one would be happy to pay £100 per month to return to the original Premier service levels.            
                Very secure an easy to use and has a very unique design to it..would always recommend...            
                Well, i was in the middle of the street and i went to a cash point and realised i had no funds on the card and i needed to transfer from my savings No panic! Barclays is an amazing bank! They have a Telephone Banking System to which i subscribed in case i was in the conditions i was that day. I called right away, but i was put on hold... and here the best... There were 3C that evening, It was cold and i have been on the line waiting in the streets for almost 18 minutes and 52 seconds!!!  At the end i had to hang up without speaking with an advisor nor sorting my money problem out, plus spending almost £5 for this very useful and helpful phone call!I complained 2 days after and they replied saying it was a mere accident. On top of this they wrote that Telephone Banking Service and Customer Service are the same team and the way they manage staffing levels can sometimes create this kind of accidents. Of course it makes me feel that staff levels are not managed adequately and I think that if this has happened once it will happen again. Also, it looks like that even if you are logged in Telephone Banking Service you always go through the "general" Customer Service, therefore, not only there is no team dedicated to the service, but you don't even have a priority when you go through "general" Customer Service. However 18 minutes 52 seconds waiting time is an INSANITY in any ways!!If they can't handle this small operations, i wonder how they manage our money... oh wait a second ... Barclays international bank rating has been downgraded... in march i'm out!            
                Have been a customer for many years, I think I would be regarded as a good customer throughout.Recently started to have trouble accessing my balances via the online service and got locked out.  Went through the usual processes and got everything reset.  Then after a short while of no problems, got locked out again, and reset everything.  Then all ok for a while, and, you've guessed it, got locked out again.Couldn't have happened at a worse time.  I was unable to make online payments or transfers.  I spoke with their centralised call centre, less than helpful. So reluctantly I closed the account.  Then got a letter saying they didn't recognise my signature.  Had to visit local branch with passport etc to sort out.  Believe me my signature has never changed,  even the branch staff said that when I called.No attempt to 'save' me as a customer.  Clearly just a commodity, but the most concerning thing for me was the temporary inability to get to my money.            
                I am a happy customer of Barclays.  I have been a beneficiary of their online and telephone banking services. Whenever I visit the branch near my home I receive a good customer service. They respond really well to queries and provide quick service.            
                ignorant staff, rude service and very slow. would use a bank in the Gobi desert before I use these monkeys!            
                Had some issues but the bank manager personally took charge of the issue and resolved which i was pleased about, but there current account standard charge is a bit expensive for the small services they provide.            
                I've been with barclays for years now and it is only lethargy that keeps me with them - I feel the service is pretty poor and their charges are a disgrace. I have my mortgage and my account with them and I can't be bothered changing as all banks are the same these days.
